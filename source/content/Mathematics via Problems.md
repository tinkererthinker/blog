From [[Divine Proportions - Rational Trigonometry to Universal Geometry]]:

If $M_1, M_2$ and $M_3$ are the midpoints of the sides of the triangle $\overline{A_1 A_2 A_3}$, then $\overline{M_1 M_2 M_3}$ is also a triangle, and the circumcircle $n$ and circumcenter $N$ of $\overline{M_1 M_2 M_3}$ are respectively the nine point circle and the nine point center of the triangle $\overline{A_1 A_2 A_3}$.

Figure 18.1 shows the reason for the terminology, since in the decimal number field the nine point circle also passes through the feet $F_1, F_2$ and $F_3$ of the altitudes of $\overline{A_1 A_2 A_3}$, as well as the midpoints $P_1, P_2$ and $P_3$ of the respective sides $\overline{A_1 O}, \overline{A_2 O}$ and $\overline{A_3 O}$. Also shown in this Figure is the Euler line $e$.
