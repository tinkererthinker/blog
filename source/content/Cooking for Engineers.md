how to make the cooking experience easier, tastier and quicker

## Backstory

Let's be real: I suck at cooking.

I live in a small studio apartment with a small ass kitchen.
I'm not in great shape either, and we all know that having a great diet makes up for 90% of your health. 

In order to do that, I need to get good at cooking to be able to make affordable, healthy and tasty meals. Usually, you would have learnt it while being still a teenager, but I never did and my parents never showed me how, so here we are.

Tomatoes taste better if you don't store them in the fridge. I washed them and put them in some tupper ware.
