Is there any documentation of the infrastructure at @Dynamicland1 (e.g. cameras, lights, Raspberry Pis) and how to assemble it?

So that communities anywhere could start hacking together their own #dynamicland workspaces?

FWIW there is @JanPaul123's https://paperprograms.org already available. It's not the same and you would have to build your own local community ... but it's really a dream I'd recommend not to wait.
