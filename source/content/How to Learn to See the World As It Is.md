[[Thread by @ejames_c how to seek feedback]]

> The irony is that unclear feedback can sometimes be helpful, EVEN IF it makes skill acquisition slower. Why? Because it trains the student to do something more valuable: ==sense-making to figure out which bits of their experience actually matter.==

>  if you reframe the training task as about transforming the way students SEE, then you naturally lean towards training exercises that give messy feedback, just like reality.

How does the brain remember what is important?
- access to unstructured learning environments in which children which bits of their experience are essential by listening to their feelings
- abstract thinking is not possible without learning to feel your feelings

## Your Money or Your Life

> Answering this question helps you develop an **internal yardstick for fulfillment** and in the process kick any unhealthy shopping habits. You may discover that you’ve been measuring your fulfillment, or lack of it, by what those around you have or by what advertising says you should want. Being fulfilled is having just enough. Think about it. Whether it’s food or money or things, if you don’t know, from an internal standard, what is enough, then you will pass directly from “not enough” to “too much,” with “enough” being like a little whistle-stop town. You blink and you’ve missed it. You will rarely have an experience of fulfillment. By diligently working with this question you will begin to identify, for yourself, an internal yardstick that you can use to measure how much is enough.

> ==The primary tool for developing this internal yardstick is awareness.== The affluence that surrounds us has been called the American Dream, and with good reason: we’ve been asleep. We wake up by questioning the dream. 

> Asking yourself, month in, month out, whether you actually got fulfillment in proportion to life energy spent in each subcategory ==awakens that natural sense of knowing __when enough is enough__.==

> Having an internal yardstick for fulfillment is actually one part of what we call Financial Integrity. You learn to make your financial choices independently of what advertising and industry have decided would be good for their business.
