# What I'm Doing Now

Currently, [I'm studying]([[Today I Learned]]) [[Mechanistic Interpretability]] from the perspective of a math student. MI is the field of reverse engineering neural networks.

I'm also attempting to understand the [[Chord Protocol]] which answers the question "How to efficiently locate the node that stores a specific piece of data in a network of nodes?". I got interested in internet protocols after reading "[[Where Wizards Stay Up Late - The Origins of the Internet]]" which made me wonder why computer networks have been invented in the first place.
- Learn [[Distributed Systems]]!

I'm also fascinated by the [[Linear Algebra | structure of roots of polynomials]].
- Elliptic Curve Cryptography
- deep dive into [[Timothy Gowers]]' [[Mathematical Discussions]]
