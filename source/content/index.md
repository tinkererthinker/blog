# What I'm doing Now

Currently, I'm studying [[Mechanistic Interpretability]] from the perspective of a math student. MI is the field of reverse engineering neural networks.

I'm also attempting to understand the [[Chord Protocol]] which answers the question "How to efficiently locate the node that stores a specific piece of data in a network of nodes?". I got interested in internet protocols after reading "[[Where Wizards Stay Up Late - The Origins of the Internet]]" which made me wonder why computer networks have been invented in the first place.
