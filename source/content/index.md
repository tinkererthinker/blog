# What I'm Doing Now

Currently, [[Today I Learned | I'm studying]] [[Mechanistic Interpretability]] from the perspective of a math student. 

I'm also attempting to understand the [[Chord Protocol]] which answers the question "How to efficiently locate the node that stores a specific piece of data in a network of nodes?". I got interested in internet protocols after reading "[[Where Wizards Stay Up Late - The Origins of the Internet]]" which made me wonder why computer networks have been invented in the first place.
- Learn [[Distributed Systems]]!

Patrick Honner nerdsniped me into studying the [[Linear Algebra | structure of roots of polynomials]].
- Check out his article: [The Symmetry That Makes Solving Math Equations Easy](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-symmetry-that-makes-solving-math-equations-easy-20230324/)
- Deep dive into [[Timothy Gowers]]' [[Mathematical Discussions]]. I like that he isn't just winging it. He clearly motivates the definitions, and the way he approaches problems is very natural and intuitive. He makes you feel like you could come up with these questions by yourself.

*As I'm articulating my current priorities, I notice that it is quite difficult to get the frame right. It still feels like I'm gathering disparate pieces of a larger puzzle... Thanks to Derek Sivers for inspiring me to create my own [now page](https://nownownow.com/about) and thanks to [defenderofbasic](https://x.com/DefenderOfBasic) for helping me to [set up my own blog](https://github.com/DefenderOfBasic/obsidian-quartz-template)!*
