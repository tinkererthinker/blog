## Documenting my journey from high school math to cutting-edge ML/AI

As I was trying to pick up [[Machine Learning]] and [[Abstract Algebra]], I realised that I had huge knowledge gaps in some math foundations. Past attempts of self-teaching myself like watching lectures and reading textbooks were unsuccessful and time-consuming though. Luckily enough, I came across Math Academy which has helped me to accelerate my learning process.

My goal is to contribute to tinygrad and work with George Hotz at tinycorp some day.
