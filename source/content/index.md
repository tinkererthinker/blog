# What I'm Doing Now

As I was trying to pick up [[Machine Learning]] and [[Abstract Algebra]], I realised that I had huge knowledge gaps in some math foundations. Past attempts of self-teaching myself were unsuccessful and time-consuming though. Luckily enough, I came across Math Academy which has helped me to accelerate my learning process.

*As I'm articulating my current priorities, I notice that it is quite difficult to get the frame right. It still feels like I'm gathering disparate pieces of a larger puzzle... Thanks to Derek Sivers for inspiring me to create my own [now page](https://nownownow.com/about) and thanks to [defenderofbasic](https://x.com/DefenderOfBasic) for helping me to [set up my own blog](https://github.com/DefenderOfBasic/obsidian-quartz-template)!*
