We are all too familiar with it. It's the mathematical equivalent to how to draw a fucking owl. Trivial. Why can't you see it? The proof is obvious!

## Guides

- [[Cooking for Engineers]] (noobish)
- [[How to Improvise And Compose Music]]
- [[Automatically Merge Obsidian Conflicts]]
- [[So You Want to Be A Programmer]]

## Now reading

These are the books I would recommend in order to [[How to Learn to See the World As It Is|learn to see the world as it is]].
