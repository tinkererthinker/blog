what I figured out through trial and error

Does relative pitch work for complicated chords?

I was blown away by this video.

## Steps
1. Develop a very good ear with ear training and studying advanced music theory.
	1. You want to get to a point where your hands and instrument are just an extension of your mind. Lack of ability can break the flow making it difficult to improvise.
2. Listen to music and identify cells (riffs, voicings, melodies,...)
	1. It is very important to be able to extract these sounds on the spot when they are resonating the most with you. In my experience, making music depends a lot on the space I inhabit and the mood I am in. A lot of my frustration came from not being able to translate the sound I hear in my mind to the instrument.
3. Practicing means to apply new concepts to your own improvisations and compositions. Push it to its limits and discover what is possible.
