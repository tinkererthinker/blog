		-  **[Using uv with PyTorch](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/pytorch/)** ([via](https://twitter.com/charliermarsh/status/1858966355518878163 "@charliermarsh")) PyTorch is a notoriously tricky piece of Python software to install, due to the need to provide separate wheels for different combinations of Python version and GPU accelerator (e.g. different CUDA versions).
			- using uv with [[tinygrad]]
				- In the meantime, you can make sense of tinygrad's architecture on google colab.
		- uv now has dedicated documentation for PyTorch which I'm finding really useful - it clearly explains the challenge and then shows exactly how to configure a `pyproject.toml` such that `uv` knows which version of each package it should install from where.
			- You don't have to manually install packages anymore! Instead, you write a program that automates that process.
- quartz config
	- [ ] display source property
- Rust has made it easier to build command line tools which made it easier to build package managers like uv and pixi. We are about to topple the [[local first]] domino!
	- There is an ongoing shift from data silos, SaaS to markdown files, dynamic documents as personal software.
		- What is going to accelerate this transition?
			- making export options available
- [ ] update front page
