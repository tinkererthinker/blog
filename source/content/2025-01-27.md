- begging engineers who are very good at debugging to understand that the same exact meta-skill can be used on people. You can crack people, you can predict them with extreme accuracy. You are smart, you are very smart. You can do this [[@DefenderOfBasic]]
	- I can predict how I am going to behave as a math beginner. Which mistakes do I  frequently make? How to fix them? Why is this person behaving like they are drunk? 
		- In [[The Inner Game of Tennis]], the author shows a technique called nonjudgmental observation to improve your play.
		- in [[The Design of Everyday Things]] there is a chapter calledÂ "Human Error? No, Bad Design". I can redesign the math so that the mistake doesn't happen next time!
