	- The takeaway of this strategy is easy to state:
		- If you aren’t sure how to approach a problem, don’t start by trying to write code. Plan until you understand the problem.
			Newer programmers often ignore this advice, assuming that the fastest way to produce working code for a programming problem is to start writing code (especially if you see classmates who are able to jump directly to writing code). Experienced programmers know that trying to write all the code before you’ve understood the problem will take much longer than stepping back and understanding the problem first. As you develop your programming skills, the specific format of your task plans will evolve (and indeed, we will see some cases of this later in the book as well). But the core idea is the same: use concrete examples to help identify the intermediate computations that will need, then convert those intermediate computations to code after or as you figure them out.
