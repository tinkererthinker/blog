## Thoughts after 2100 XP (~ 35 hours of work)

![[Pasted image 20250506213145.png|200]]

What have I learned? What intrigued me about this process?

I took the diagnostics, still the exercises felt too easy and not challenging enough.

Now, I completed 78% of math foundations II. Maybe it's time to switch to MF3.

I felt like something was missing.

> In my experience, the only way to successfully teach a more sophisticated technique is to present a problem where known simpler techniques fail.

> If you want your students to understand why a more sophisticated definition is preferable, then you have to introduce them to a situation where the simpler definition breaks down and the sophisticated definition saves the day. ~ [Justin Skycak](https://www.justinmath.com/the-only-way-to-successfully-teach-a-more-sophisticated-technique/)

how to learn new concepts

Cast some complicated problem into your chosen programming language/abstract framework and model it yourself, try to reinvent it there.

From Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs:

> You develop a language (sometimes consisting just of one or two functions) such that the solution of the problem can be trivially expressed in it.
> 
> Many problems in computer science become significantly more tractable if you have a tool for expressing __your own way of thought__, not the way of thought of the machine. You write programs for yourself in the first place. It's similar to mathematics: when proving a theorem, you prove it (using the language of formal algebra/calculus/etc.) to yourself, trying to figure out the best way to do it, using as little efforts as possible and being elegant.
