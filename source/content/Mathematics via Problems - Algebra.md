### Solving Polynomial Equations of Degree 3 and 4

#### 3.2.5. Vieta's method. 

(a) Solve $4 x^3-3 x=\frac{1}{2}$.
(b) Solve $x^3-3 x-1=0$.
(c) Use the cosine and inverse cosine functions to devise a general formula for the solution of $x^3+p x+q=0$ by the method outlined in these problems. Under what conditions can $x^3+p x+q=0$ be solved by this method?
