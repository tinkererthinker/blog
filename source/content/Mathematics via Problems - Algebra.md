Much of this book is accessible to high school students with a strong interest in mathematics. ${ }^3$ We provide definitions or references for material that is not standard in the school curriculum. However, many topics are difficult if you study them "from scratch." Thus, the ordering of the problems helps to provide "scaffolding." At the same time, many topics are independent of each other. For more details, see p. xviii, "How this book is organized".

# 3. Polynomials and Complex Numbers
### 2. Solving Polynomial Equations of Degree 3 and 4

#### 3.2.5. Vieta's method. 

(a) Solve $4 x^3-3 x=\frac{1}{2}$.
(b) Solve $x^3-3 x-1=0$.
(c) Use the cosine and inverse cosine functions to devise a general formula for the solution of $x^3+p x+q=0$ by the method outlined in these problems. Under what conditions can $x^3+p x+q=0$ be solved by this method?

Triple angle formulas. You can easily reconstruct these from the addition and double angle formulas.

3.2.5. (a) Similarly to 3.1 .5 (b) $\cos \frac{\pi}{9}, \cos \frac{7 \pi}{9}$, and $\cos \frac{13 \pi}{9}$ are the roots of $4 y^3-3 y=\frac{1}{2}$. By 3.3.5 (b) there are no other roots.

Answer: $x \in\left\{\cos \frac{\pi}{9}, \cos \frac{7 \pi}{9}, \cos \frac{13 \pi}{9}\right\}$.
(b) The substitution $y=2 x$ reduces this to (a).

Answer: $x \in\left\{2 \cos \frac{\pi}{9}, 2 \cos \frac{7 \pi}{9}, 2 \cos \frac{13 \pi}{9}\right\}$.


The roots $r_1, r_2, r_3$ of the cubic polynomial $P(x)=a x^3+b x^2+c x+d$ satisfy
$$
r_1+r_2+r_3=-\frac{b}{a}, \quad r_1 r_2+r_1 r_3+r_2 r_3=\frac{c}{a}, \quad r_1 r_2 r_3=-\frac{d}{a}
$$
