(a) Solve $4 x^3-3 x=\frac{1}{2}$.
(b) Solve $x^3-3 x-1=0$.
(c) Use the cosine and inverse cosine functions to devise a general formula for the solution of $x^3+p x+q=0$ by the method outlined in these problems. Under what conditions can $x^3+p x+q=0$ be solved by this method?

(a) Use de Moivre's theorem to prove the identity

$$
\cos 6 \alpha=32 \cos ^6 \alpha-48 \cos ^4 \alpha+18 \cos ^2 \alpha-1
$$

(b) Hence show that the polynomial equation $32 x^6-48 x^4+18 x^2-1=0$ has roots $x=\cos \frac{n \pi}{12}$, for $n=1,3,5,7,9,11$.


(c) Use the product of these six roots to deduce that $\cos \frac{\pi}{12} \cos \frac{5 \pi}{12}=\frac{1}{4}$.
