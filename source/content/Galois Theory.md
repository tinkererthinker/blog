[3:40] Galois considered fields extended by rational functions in the variable p, and that enabled him to make the correspondence between permutation groups and fields.

> But this massive work is an attempt to curate sequences of problems for secondary students (the stated focus is high school students, but that can be broadly interpreted) that allow them to discover and recreate much of “elementary” mathematics (number theory, polynomials, inequalities, calculus, geometry, combinatorics, game theory, probability) and start edging into the sophisticated world of group theory, Galois theory, etc. ~ [[Mathematics via Problems - Algebra]]
