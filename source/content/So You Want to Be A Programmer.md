I'm not a fan of most programming courses, so I decided to write my own guide.

My hard drive is full so, I want to analyse which directories contain the biggest files.

I remember from [[Small, Sharp Software Tools]] that there are command line tools you can use to do exactly that.

This looks like a table. Where have I analysed tables before? [[A Data-Centric Introduction to Computer Science]]!

So, how can we improve the list's readability?
