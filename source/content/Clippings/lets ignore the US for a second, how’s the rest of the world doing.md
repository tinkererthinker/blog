So we have two more months of lovely "suspense" until the next election round - yay. Also, "suspense" since imo they're both as bad as the other but in different fun ways, so yeah.

Du musst natürlich nicht, aber versuch ein offenes Ohr dafür zu behalten was der Gegenseite am Herzen liegt. Ich versuch das als Linker (in deinem (assumed) Weltbild vielleicht sogar Linksextremer) auch zu tun, und bin nicht bei allem Einverstanden was die Partei sagt, und noch weniger bei dem was Einzelpersonen so von sich geben. Transpersonen sind schützenswert, aber nicht unser Hauptproblem. Massentierhaltung ist grausam, aber mein Gott, man löst nicht alles auf einmal. Akzeptanzbewegungen sind legitim und wichtig, aber manche machen das zur Religion. Das ist nicht gleichbedeutend mit links-sein.

The economy is running a huge surplus so money is being invested in infrastructure and progress however limitations in the availability of workers among other reasons are stifling progress and meaning the housing issue isn't improving currently. Public transport is rather poor. But other than that life is pretty peaceful. Our politicians, while I don't agree with many of them, at least appear to have the interests of the public in mind.

> India is struggling.Currently the mainstream media is discussing a stupid ass(dark) joke someone made on a YouTube show.So big this has become that police went to the studio within 24 hours.This much effort and discussion doesn't happen when there are actually crimes happening gaining us worldwide fame. Women are heading towards a 4B movement which might be a global trend though. Politicians are literally like the rest of the world,air is becoming less and less breathable with each second.World's largest democracy in name only. There is much more obviously.
