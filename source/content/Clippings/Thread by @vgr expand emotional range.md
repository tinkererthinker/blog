I used to think limiting self-perceptions are mainly about beliefs. Putting yourself in a box made up of fixed mindset beliefs about yourself.

Now I think the walls of the box represent emotional range. What you believe about yourself is a function of what you let yourself feel.

Arendt’s taxonomy is useful for classifying emotions.

Labor/domestic emotions: pain, bliss, joy, fear, compassion

Maker/agora emotions: satisfaction, frustration, righteousness, happiness, sadness

Action/polis emotions: exhilaration, terror, anger, vengefulness, poignancy

The range expands the further you go from home and expand your spatio-temporal horizons

Aesthetic and competitive emotions live on the edge between making and action. Artists and traders are almost-complete humans. Edge of being of homo faber. Not yet prepared to appear in public and be recognized as human and part of history, but willing to appear by proxy.

Domestic emotions are limited in space but also in time to +/- 1 generation.

Trying to get at the long-term emotional toll of domestic cozy, the cost of having a mind bound within ‘narrow domestic walls’ as Tagore called it.

This is high-modernist idealism, but it gets at something deep. I’d like to see a cyberpunk/hacker sensibility postmodern-pragmatic GenX version of this poem. A $5 challenge.

I am trying hard to figure out the motivation(s) for self-limited emotional range. Some of it is simple aversion to feeling “bad” but some is complex - like thinking anger is distasteful, sadness reveals weakness, etc

I'm not sure I get this.

Is the point that people are afraid to work on something difficult, try something ambitious because they're scared they'll fail?

ie issue is fear of failure (or being mocked along the way) NOT belief that they perhaps can't do it?
