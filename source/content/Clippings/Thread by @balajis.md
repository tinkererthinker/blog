Collapse doesnâ€™t just lead magically to the new thing. In fact, the new thing needs to be built before the collapse.

Friedman talked about this. The ideas need to be out there, and some of the execution too, even if the environment is unfavorable.

Thatâ€™s hard, but itâ€™s everything.

Somehow we need to prove the new system with tiny amounts of political capital before we get large amounts of it.

Yes, exactly.

Eventually, the system may fail to the point that it canâ€™t even fully stop its competitors.

Then one can build alternatives on the edge of empire.

Mass exit to those alternatives is what catalyzes the long-overdue collapse.

But those alternatives must exist. https://https://t.co/oBtjOw6b0K

What can you build if political capital is highly limited?

Yes, I know you could fix everything if you were president of Earth.

But thatâ€™s like starting with trillions in capital.

The point of a startup is to build with minimal initial capital.

So too for a startup societyâ€¦

The political capital analogy is actually very powerful.

Everyone starts by imagining themselves to be a political trillionaire, in full control of the government, and only \*then\* making their desired reforms.

Need concrete thinking on capital-light, incremental pathsâ€¦

Who would be a good source organization to gift the ENS name miltonfriedman.eth to?

The good ppl at ENS and ensfairy.eth know how to get it under their control, so it could be gifted to a good organization that stands for the principles of Friedman.

This is why big government promises are usually the go to "solution" in emergencies. It is the idea that is always lying around.

We can't change direction if the path doesn't already exist.

A Tamiá¸» aphorism comes to mind, which calls upon us to \*cultivate the will\* to do right, instead of saying just "Do right!". The first can (and should) be done even in unfavourable circumstances where the second can't be.
