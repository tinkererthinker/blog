ok I figured out how this works. People who think that social interaction is confusing & the rules are random keep trying to figure out the rules, but there is a layer of underlying rules that is much more predictable

Prep-planned scripts for social interactions are training wheels, and they prevent you from actually learning the underlying rules. You have to prompt real humans over & over to learn this. Good news: a lot of them crave earnest interaction on the internet. Go practice there.

I have been told by multiple people irl I am "very charismatic". It's because I have socialising routines I developed after playing loads of 4x games. Here's a simple one:

1\. Perform greetings.

2\. Ask conversation partner about themselves or make observation about them.

3\. Listen to them talk about themselves for a while. Smile. Be genuinely interested.

4\. Take whatever it is they said about themselves and feed it back to them through the medium of the most complementary interpretation of that fact.

5\. Watch them smile in delight. Win get.

This is the simplest routine that has wide application. There is refinement of this routine as well as fall back routines, but this is a good one to use with strangers.
