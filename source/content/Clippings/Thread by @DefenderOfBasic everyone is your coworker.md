I just think if we all started thinking of society as one big very dysfunctional company everything starts to make a lot more sense

(and it becomes very clear what you can do to make it better)

everyone is your coworker, whether you like it or not. This is just the way it is.

It doesn't mean you have to work together, you might never see each other, but you share resources. Their wants/needs/what their doing impacts you. That's just the way it is.

Everyone is your coworker. Now what? You have a bunch of coworkers you hate, you can't stand them. They don't like you very much either. But here we are. What are you going to do about it?

what \*do\* you do in your actual job when you have conflict? you can't block people, you have to resolve conflict

the greatest irony of the modern times is that people have more resilient relationships with their coworkers than they do with friends.

friends often shy away from conflict. coworkers have to deal with it and still see each other the next day
