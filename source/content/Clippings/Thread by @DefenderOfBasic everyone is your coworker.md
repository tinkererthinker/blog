I just think if we all started thinking of society as one big very dysfunctional company everything starts to make a lot more sense

(and it becomes very clear what you can do to make it better)

everyone is your coworker, whether you like it or not. This is just the way it is.

It doesn't mean you have to work together, you might never see each other, but you share resources. Their wants/needs/what their doing impacts you. That's just the way it is.

Everyone is your coworker. Now what? You have a bunch of coworkers you hate, you can't stand them. They don't like you very much either. But here we are. What are you going to do about it?

what \*do\* you do in your actual job when you have conflict? you can't block people, you have to resolve conflict

the greatest irony of the modern times is that people have more resilient relationships with their coworkers than they do with friends.

friends often shy away from conflict. coworkers have to deal with it and still see each other the next day

i want a twitter profile name change thing to be automatic, like slack. I want it to show when I am "🟢 online" and when I alt-tab into my blog/obsidian I want it to show "✍️"

my twitter is my slack. the people of the internet are all my coworkers. everyone is so helpful

holy shit, I had this feeling almost exactly a year ago! Look at this

> Checking this Twitter account feels like checking my work slack (in that I feel a sense of purpose & belonging, there's projects to check on and help out with and lend my voice to)
> 
> Except instead of making money the goal is learning about ourselves & the human spirit

I think I noticed this because I felt a safe space on twitter to express curiosity & ask questions. then I started doing that at work and everything got better. I started making slack threads the way I make twitter threads

I started pretending like, the same relationship I have with my real coworkers, can I do it on twitter?

the idea being that, i don't have to like my coworkers, but I am stuck with them, so I have to work with them. this is true of the people of earth

> I treat every person I meet on Twitter like a coworker. It doesn't mean i like everyone, it's ok to hate some people . But you still have to work with them, or at least, live in the same world. Keep that in mind. We're trying to make this place liveable

i used to get stuck a lot in my dayjob, spinning my wheels for days. then I stopped doing that. if I am stuck, I post on slack.

I was worried I was wasting the team's time by asking questions. Someone said: "you \*are\* the team, you're wasting time NOT asking questions"

so I stopped getting stuck at work. Then I realized, wait! does the same thing work online? if everyone is my coworker, can I just...post when I am stuck? and people will help unblock me?

I can, and they have. Look at me go. I've learned SO much in the past 6 months.
