I think "personal malleable software" is what I've been trying to articulate for the past few months. I think this is why I made this a bookmarklet vs an extension

it can be forked without permission & without the creator even being aware

another recurring theme for me is "No UIs". I want twitter, and spotify, and my email to offer by default a \`/json\` page. No API key required, this is for my personal use. I pay for your service, I deserve my own UI. Can we have this world?

One I'm most excited about it is this epiphany that: the entire internet is made of HTML! the average user can just edit it and reshare it! (document.contentEditable = true makes it even easier)

I've been wanting to organize a little "let's fork the web!" jam, to kind of break the taboo that it's wrong to copy parts of the web and edit them

there's building blocks everywhere. we can collage the web we want to see

this is probably my most useful idea of interaction between LLM and user interface, better reading tools. I really should make a prototype of this and write it up somewhere
