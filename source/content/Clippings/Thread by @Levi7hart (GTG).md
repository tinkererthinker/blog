i trained for a lot - mainly standard bodybuilding style training.

when i found Pavel Tsatsouline saying to do greasing the groove (frequently perform sub-maximal sets of an exercise throughout the day to improve neural pathways and strength without causing fatigue) i thought it was so silly and crazy

tried it for like 2-3 months and i moved up to 180kg (396 lb) squats.. huh? how the fk did that happen, everyone i knew doing strength training said that the only way to get strong was lifting very heavy.. but this whole premise was to lift in a way where you never feel strain or even muscle soreness.

now i was already a strong squatter, but still, i like 4x’d my strength in the shortest time i’d ever done while working out.

i also got very ripped and looked better than i had for a long time.

but everyone i know who was a really og trainer or lifter said that method couldn’t build muscle or strength

there’s a lot of bro science even at high levels of fitness experts, but it still blew me away that this was so easy and was working very well for me.

it’s time intensive but still , i have a home gym so it’s fine.

probably shouldn’t extrapolate that too everything but i think sometimes doing counterintuitive strategies pay off well

in fact 2-3 months is probably not accurate i think it was closer to 1.5-2 months before i got my squat to that

and i wasn’t squatting that as a 1 rep max, no i was doing 5 reps.. also doing it like over and over throughout the day without issue because the gtg methodology is

I hung one of those "iron gym" bars in a doorway and made a rule that I give it a try every time I passed underneath. Went from a couple inches to a full pull up in no time flat and extended the rule to 1 pull up any time I walked under something suitable.
