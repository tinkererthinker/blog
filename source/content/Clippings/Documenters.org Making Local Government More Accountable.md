We’re putting every public meeting on the record in [Centre County](https://centrecounty-pa.documenters.org/)

## Who we are

A network of newsrooms and community organizations committed to participatory civic media.
## What we do

We **train and pay** hundreds of people to attend under-reported public meetings and publish the results.

## We’re building a new public record

Your elected officials are making big decisions. Keep tabs with original notes, live-tweet threads and multimedia reports from Documenters in your area—updated daily

## What our network is saying

Get involved in our community of practice.

### A unique civic education

> “How are your tax dollars spent? What are your elected officials doing? Are they listening to you? What is the process? That, as a Documenter, is what you have to show people.”

### Community reporting

> “In almost every case for a meeting that I’ve covered, I’ve been the only person connected to the media that has been in the room.”

### Local connections

> “I've learned from other Documenters… I’ve learned skills that helped me to not just be a better citizen but also inform the type of work that I want to do.”
