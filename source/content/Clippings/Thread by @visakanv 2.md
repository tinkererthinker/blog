a thing that always trips me out is reflecting on the distribution of effort to reward. most of the rewards i get in my life today are for efforts i put in 10, 15 years ago, which at the time often seemed like it was fruitless

like right now I could say "buy my book, http://gum.co/introspect", and I will make money in a matter of seconds. it's effortless. but it took me years of effort to get good at writing, and then years more to write the book and to build the audience that enables this

i got my last 10k followers on here in just 4 months. it took me like 10 years to get the first 10k. as long as Twitter itself doesn't die, i'll probably cross 100k late next year, and it will seem comparatively effortless. just need to keep showing up and having fun

like, 2010 visa was much more impressive than 2023 visa, because he busted his ass with nothing to show for it, and kept at it regardless. it's comparatively easy to be 2023 visa, he has the benefit of a badass like 2010 visa struggling and sacrificing to build him a better life

the parking lot gig is more impressive than the super bowl gig

by the time you get the super bowl gig, you have a team, you have an audience, people are rooting for you to succeed

the parking lot gig its just you and your dream
