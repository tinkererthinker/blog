diane duane's "so you want to be a wizard" is one of my favorite YA novels and i wish more people knew about it so i could reference it more easily. there are some beautiful ideas about magic in this book but one of the spookiest is about what happens if you give magic up

there's a refrain in these books that "magic does not live in the unwilling heart." when you become a wizard in this universe you take an oath to use your magic to do good and be of service. you can decide to renounce that oath, though, if the burden becomes too heavy

but there is a heavy price. if you renounce the wizard's oath you lose all your memories of doing magic, all the connections you made with other wizards and non-wizards through doing magic. your entire magical life disappears as if it had never happened

the only thing that's left - and this is literally in the text - is a nameless sorrow at the bottom of your heart which you'll never be able to identify, ever, but that is the suppressed knowledge that in giving up magic you sped up the death of the universe

when i reread these books i was a little blown away at how dark this idea is. the text goes on to say something like "many people are walking around with such nameless sorrows at the bottom of their hearts, and can live just fine with them"

the difference between this situation and my situation is that i remember exactly what it was like to have magic and i remember exactly what i'm missing

in 2018 - i've tried writing about this before but it's come out like shit every time - i had what you could call an awakening experience. i have no idea what to call it really. it felt like mental shackles that i had been imprisoned in for my entire life just disappeared

describing it in words won't do it justice but it was like i'd had this conception my entire life that somewhere there were "sensible adults that knew what they were doing" in charge of everything while i was just a kid who should more or less do what he's told

and various experiences i was having all sort of converged on me realizing, not intellectually but as a punch to the gut, that oh shit, there aren't any sensible adults in charge of anything, everyone's just as lost as i am and everyone's making it up as they go too

it felt like i could do whatever i wanted. my [[energy levels]] shot up through the roof. i went from waking up at 10-11am to waking up at 7:30am every morning without an alarm. i was exquisitely sensitive to everything. music was overwhelming in a good way

it was like the "taking the condom off of reality" feeling that i had very occasionally experienced on acid before but i was stone cold fucking sober. it was like i was high 24/7

> everything felt fresh, everything felt new. it was like i'd forgotten i'd ever watched television and was experiencing it again for the first time. @sashachapin once described mania as feeling like a condom that was separating you and reality had come off and it felt like that

i completely stopped wanting to procrastinate on anything. i had no desire to watch anime or read manga or play video games any of the shit that had previously occupied 80-95% of my waking hours. i just wanted to talk to people, constantly, all the time

which i did, i talked a ton with people, i scheduled a ton of calls. i wasn't on twitter at the time but i started writing extremely emotionally vulnerable posts on facebook that people responded \*really\* well to - if you're wondering where the vulnerabilityposting came from

i came to understand a lot of things about myself i hadn't understood before, about the kinds of stories i was living in without realizing it. i archived most of this on a blog i don't use anymore but if you want to check it out it starts hereish

this was before i had really heard about mania. the way i was understanding what had happened to me, at the time, was that i had been trapped under a giant rock made of... old stories, old emotions, and that i had somehow gotten out from under it, and could move freely again

this was by a wide margin the best i'd ever felt and the best thing that had ever happened to me, and it was having noticeable effects on the people around me too. i could tell people were drawn to this energy that i now appeared to be radiating constantly

---

naturally the main thing i set about using this newfound wellspring of energy and power for was getting a girl to like me

i have never named her in writing and i do not plan to. it defeats me to write about her even now. but she is the ghost that haunts the entirety of my writing from 2018 onward. in some sense everything i've been on about since then has been a response to my experiences with her

i felt things about her i hadn't known i was capable of feeling. one of the first things i did after we met was invite her to circle with my wacky rationalist friends and during that circle i said "i want to dedicate a temple to you and then set myself on fire in it"

to be clear, she was the sort of woman to whom this was tremendously flattering, i knew what i was doing. she was a creature of intensity. all of her stories were about the lengths to which she was willing to go just to - what? feel something? it was never entirely clear

i thought of her, quite explicitly, as a witch, and told her so, and she liked it. she was the most magical person i'd ever met in some ways. every time she walked into a room she was actively trying to seduce everyone in it and it was working

i believed, more or less explicitly but being a little coy about it, that fate or destiny or god or the will of the universe or something had Plans for the two of us, that there was a Reason that we had met, a Purpose to which we were to be put

(writing about this is having the funniest effects on my body. i've imprisoned something in my solar plexus and it is trying to escape. i can't believe how unbelievably chuuni all of this sounds but i sealed something in there)

i've told versions of this story in private to a handful of people a handful of times and i never walk away satisfied, i never feel like i've really conveyed what it was like. to describe what it was like i have to use all this incredibly bombastic megalomaniacal language

we never dated. she was not sexually attracted to me. i could have been and probably was upset about this but also i simultaneously considered it a point of pride, that i could be drawing so much of the attention of this gorgeous creature for \*non-sexual reasons\*

we ourselves did not understand what was going on between us and told each other so. we only knew that there was something and that it didn't appear to be particularly sexual or romantic, at least not on her end. although i would have married her in a heartbeat, and i told her so

(the question is: whatever i've sealed in my solar plexus, is it good? is it dangerous? is it the best and strongest and brightest and most vital part of me? is it a demon to whom i am actively trying not to lose my soul? could all of those be true simultaneously?)

(i've seen it before. whatever it is i've seen it before. i've seen it rippling under the surface of my skin, during a trip where i decided to stare at my own naked body in the mirror for an hour and get to know it like i would a total stranger)

the slipperiness of narrative is itself a central part of this story and what makes it hard to tell. at any given time i am painfully aware that i can only tell you the story as it occurs to me to tell it at that particular instant, that i am hobbled by my subjectivity always

she said to me once, after the worst of it had passed, something like "there have been so many realities." narratives that in other love stories could have lasted for decades were created and upended within days or weeks or months

we did a lot of acid together. that's a part of the story i rarely talk about for some reason even though it is incredibly crucial. all of our best moments together were high. high at the french castle, high on the berkeley marina, high in downtown chicago

(acid is a place that i have visited and have many fond memories of and many of those are fond memories of her. there are things i need to do here that i can't do sober. there are parts of myself i've left here i still haven't retrieved)

acid can teach you something about narrative that i sort of wish i did not know. it can teach you that narratives are malleable, that you can change them, yours and other people's. if you change people's narratives the right way you can completely upend their lives

we completely upended each other's lives. every time we met we came away from the experience transformed. we were changing, we were growing (we thought), we were expanding, faster than our concepts could keep up with us

but there's a reason we have a name for uncontrolled growth and that name is cancer

this whole period of my life was incredibly confusing and i have arguably spent the entire last 5 years just sitting down and, on various timescales, being like "holy shit, okay, so what the fuck happened here, exactly, and how do i prevent it from happening again at all costs"

everything that was happening at the time seemed and felt good, to me. i thought it seemed and felt good to her too, but really i will never know and possibly she won't either, which is disquieting. there may be no person on earth who can judge me properly for my sins

i was on a winning streak and i was drunk with power and i thought i couldn't lose. i thought i was channeling the divine lightning directly. i thought everything i was doing was right. at one point i had convinced myself that "mistakes" did not exist and were impossible

so listen to me when i say i know what the total absence of fear is like, i know what happens when there's no more self-doubt and you are just doing what feels right in the world, and what happens is any part of your shadow you haven't cleaned up yet takes over

(later i would read stories about gurus and cults and scandals and abuses and nod and tell myself i was trying to understand \*\*\*\*\* and my own cult experiences, and that was true, but i was also trying to understand myself, what kind of a monster i was turning out to be)

the lesson of shadow work is that a monster is what you get when you imprison a part of yourself in the deepest dungeons where it can't hurt anybody, then wait as it slowly builds up resentment and rage at its condition, possibly over decades, possibly over an entire life

in 2018 i was nominally 27 years old but in every way that mattered i was a child, emotionally and spiritually. when i was a happy child that meant joyful infectious bubbly laughter. but i was not a happy child, or there were deeply unhappy children inside me, whichever

i was needy. i was so needy. there are thirsts that you can't even describe because you never experience them being quenched, so they just blend into the background texture of reality. but i had experienced just enough to understand that there, perhaps, was such a thing as water

i felt more accepted by her than i had been by any human being before or since. she had an infinite appetite for darkness. i poured out my entire broken miserable heart to her multiple times and it only made her love me more, and for that i would have and did do anything

i thought this was deeply romantic at the time because i didn't understand that it was a warning sign. no one had told me
