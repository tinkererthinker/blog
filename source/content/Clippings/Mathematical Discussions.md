## Mathematical discussions contents page.

These pages are of various kinds, but they are nearly all attempts to show how mathematical ideas arise naturally, in the hope that some people will find them a useful supplement to university mathematics courses. Often they contain ideas that I have come across in one way or another and wish I had been told as an undergraduate. (Probably I *was* told several of them, and just wasn't concentrating enough to take them in at the time.)
