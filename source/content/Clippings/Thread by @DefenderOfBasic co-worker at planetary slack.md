some big companies have really bad onboarding experiences. People fix that by making "unofficial onboarding guides" for their peers. Civilization needs the same thing

every team in every company has an unofficial onboarding guide that anyone can contribute to

so does every city in every country, but not everyone knows it exists / that they can contribute

"if the company fails, we all fail" is true of working at Google, and also of being a human being on planet Earth

a lot more people than you realize are in an "inner circle" with a billionaire. When I worked in big tech I regularly worked with someone who had weekly meetings with the billionaire all-powerful CEO

this is true if you work in big tech, and also true if you write little blogs and post them on twitter. twitter is interplanetary slack

everyone on earth is my co-worker, whether They like it or not

that was the initial tweet but I reworded it because I didn't want people to get too mad ðŸ˜…

people react really negatively to this "earth is one giant company" because I think they hate the idea of being trapped in a company, because they have really negative associations with working at companies in general.

but working at companies can be really fucking awesome

work isn't meant to be soulless and make you feel dead. that's not the point
