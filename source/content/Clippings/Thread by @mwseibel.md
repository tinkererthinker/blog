When I was young I thought management was about distribution/delegation of responsibilities. I now realize it is truly about the maintenance of morale and motivation. Morale and motivation are moving targets that require consistent and proactive effort to maintain.

Motivation is often the difference between a C work product and an A work product.

Founders and managers should be hyper sensitive to motivation. Often your actions/example in the workplace effect motivation far more than you might realize.

People talk about 10x engineers a lot (and they should - they are extremely valuable). They donâ€™t talk enough about 10x leaders. Leaders who can get 10x more out of the people they work with over time. That is truly an amazing skill and much more rare than a 10x engineer.
