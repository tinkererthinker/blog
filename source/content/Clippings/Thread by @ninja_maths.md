We recently received this comment from a user.

Topic: Changing a Basis Using the Change-of-Coordinates Matrix

Example: Finding the Coordinates of a Vector in a New Basis Given Its Coordinates in Another Basis

Maybe I'm just dumb, but this really feels like it's missing an explanation of why this method of Gaussian elimination works here or at least a link to the lesson where it's explained (assuming it was somewhere and I've missed it or not understood). Otherwise, I'm just plugging numbers into a formula.

Nope, definitely not dumb. In fact, this was an excellent point. The fact you can use Gaussian elimination here is not obvious, yet we initially assumed it was. We just rolled out the following update to address this. We're very grateful that you pointed this out.

This latest update means students should now have no problems understanding why Gaussian elimination works here.
