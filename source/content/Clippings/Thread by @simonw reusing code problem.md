At the start of my career OOP was being hailed as the solution to the "code re-use" problem.

These days it looks like the true silver bullet was "releasing code as open source"

I wonder if developers who started out in the last 10 years are even aware that "software re-use" used to be classified as a problem? Every project found itself building fundamentals from scratch. OOP and class inheritance were pitched as the cure - reuse existing code!

Bah humbug. Kids these days don't know how good they have it!

I didn’t even learn version control tools until I started contributing to open source! Programming in the 90s was insane.

Yeah I've been thinking recently about how the combo of solid source control and CI/CD really has resulted in a significant multiplier in team-based (and individual) software development productivity - we've got it so good!

Anyone else remember conversations circa 2001 about how OOP was going to finally free us from constantly re-writing the same code over and over again? With hindsight, we solved that problem with open source licensing and robust open source ecosystems around programming languages
- OOP was attempting to solve problems inside a code base. Open-source is about sharing a code base.
- Turns out OOP was yet another attempt at solving a social problem (sharing) with technology.

Love this categorization of open source as a "tactic".

I see OS as the solution to "code reusability". When I was at uni in the early 2000s "code reusabiilty" was THE big goal - it's what OOP was meant to do.

Turns out the way to make code truly reusable is to open source it.

There’s a great @swardley talk that hits on Netflix’s usage of OSS as a strategy for reducing costs for production houses, so that more emerge, and they can reap those benefits.

By intra you mean within a large organization? I think open source makes that work much better too.

Sets clean expectations of how contributions work, means the maintainers are more likely to consider use-cases outside their own groups, and makes IP considerations more obvious

If a team in a large org is itself working with code that's open source (or that might be released as open source in the future) they won't be blocked from using that organizations own existing code because it's closed source

I'd love to learn more about the COBOL development ecosystem. Does that ecosystem have answers for:

- version control
- unit/integration testing
- continuous integration
- open source libraries
- zero-downtime deployments
- linting
- code review https://https://t.co/tTawwLjLA9

My hunch is that those techniques are much more responsible for our modern era of massively improved software engineering productivity than programming language syntax improvements

I remember when I was at university in 2001-2004 the holy grail of software engineering was "code re-use" - everyone thought OOP and Java classes would solve that. Turns out the solution was open source libraries.
