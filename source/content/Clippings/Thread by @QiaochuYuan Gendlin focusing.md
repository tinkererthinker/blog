**QC** @QiaochuYuan 2024-10-26

people learn a lot of different therapy tools in a lot of different orders. the first one i learned was gendlin focusing and it thoroughly informed my approach not only to self-therapy but to writing. i spent a lot of time explicitly iterating on verbalizing felt senses. i was also cross-training by spending a lot of time explaining mathematics, which to me is also about verbalizing felt senses. there's very little discussion of this sort of thing in math so i don't really know how i picked up on it but to me it was obviously the thing that needed doing. you learn how to write things other people can't write by getting access to word-producing processes they don't have access to or even know exist

i think many (maybe all?) great writers are doing something like this intuitively (writing from felt senses) but i think my background is unusual in that i was explicitly taught it. i don't know if an MFA program in creative writing ever teaches you at any point how to listen to your body

would people be interested in some writing from me that goes into more detail about how i think writing is related to gendlin focusing and felt senses? claude seems to think the idea is novel, i suspect it's all somewhere in impro

Super fucking cool. I seem to recall Gendlin touches on related thoughts in "Thinking at the Edge". David Rome has a bit on felt sense and the creative process in Your Body Knows the Answer as well
