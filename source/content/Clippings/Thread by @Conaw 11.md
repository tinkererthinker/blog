90\. The Elements of Clojure is a incredible resource even for non-Clojure devs

Most important idea -- How to NAME THINGS

Naming things well is one of the hardest parts of programming, huge gains for code legibility if you do well

Great to have a guide

91\. If you are poor -- or you are living off of your nest egg to do research and worried about your burn rate -- it is 100% OK for you to pirate textbooks, O'Reilly Books, and scholarly articles.

92\. If you are rich - pay the publishers, fund the kickstarters, chip in for the Patreons.

If you run a Startup with funding or are profitably bootstrapped - everyone on your team should have an unlimited expense account for books and online courses.

93\. Open source is about increasing the information commons -- putting out free things that give other people power and agency.

There are many ways to contribute

Write tutorials, record screencasts, expand the docs, open source your example projects.

94\. If you really want to level up in a language - find a great example project and deeply study the code.

I spent hours and hours going through the @ZetawarGame code base with pen and paper to reverse engineer every decision

95\. Everyone interested in programming languages (or writing software to do powerful things) should read Paul Graham

Especially his earliest essays like

http://paulgraham.com/progbot.html

http://paulgraham.com/popular.html

and most especially \*\*Beating the Averages\*\*

http://paulgraham.com/avg.html

96\. When you read those, and the quote below has sunk in, and you start to have dreams like the xkcd author

Then consider this

97\. The WAT talk is hilarious, but when you learn a new language - don't spend ALL your time looking at it's flaws

I trolled OO hard in this thread, there are still beautiful ideas there

Explore new lands for treasures you can bring back home.

98\. Programming languages have a culture.

Go to the conferences and meetups, join the list servs, hang out on the slack channels.

If the language community isn't filled with the kind of people you want to be around -- enjoy the books, but take the ideas with you somewhere else.

99\. It's much easier to do (98) if your language has Macros though!!

And the Clojure community is exceptionally friendly to beginners and folks who don't fit the stereotypical profile.

Incredibly curious, incredibly pragmatic.

So really, my opinion is you should learn Clojure.

100\. Form your own opinions on programming languages, and share them freely.

When someone contradicts them, it is a great signal to get curious - not defensive. You may learn something

But use the block feature widely for anyone who turns disagreement into a personal attack.

👑 These are just my opinions. They may not be true, but I hope they have been interesting.

It is more important that they be interesting than true anyway.

101\. Decided I'm going to keep extending this thread

Mostly because this point from @elzr brings together my two largest points

Lisp and Excel are both powerful because they expand the domain of thinkable thoughts

Goal of @RoamResearch is to combine em
