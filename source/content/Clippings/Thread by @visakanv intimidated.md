the meta-funny thing that both men and women often seem to misunderstand about each other (and even themselves?) is that they are not motivated by the same things in the same ways. Beautiful women aren’t particularly interested in marrying beautiful men, generally speaking

saw a screenshot going around recently that was something like, “successful lady who lists out all her successes has trouble finding a man who isn’t intimidated by her”, and it’s hard to even begin to explain to a person like that how they are sabotaging themselves

it’s basically this; almost all weirdly persistent-unsolvable problems are basically this. And it typically seems rude/invasive to foist it onto another person and so we persist in our respective delusions

"they're intimidated by my brilliance" can be a great cover story for "I am bad at relating to people in a way that doesn't lead with me demanding validation for my accolades and accomplishments". and when you dig deeper into that it gets pretty sad

if you're so smart, why haven't you learnt to subvert the process by which people are intimidated by your smarts? past a certain threshold of intelligence, agency, dynamism, etc, the answer has to be that you want it that way. read David's tweet again

with power comes responsibility, and people don't like to feel responsibility for the ways in which things feel fucked up for them, so you get these funny structures like those oddly tall houses in vietnam, where people come across as both powerful and powerless at the same time

anyway the other wack thing is that the world is big and wide with tonnes of people so if you can define an exception to a supposed rule, you can actually seek out the person who is that exception to that rule. demonstrated here:

"you are responsible for the outcome of your life" is something that can be cruel to say to someone who is powerless and disenfranchised, but the more agentic you become, the truer it becomes, too. people will shy away from power to avoid responsibility

usually most people spend most of their time around peers who have similar-ish agency, so they never really have to think seriously about what it would be like for someone with an order of magnitude more or less agency
