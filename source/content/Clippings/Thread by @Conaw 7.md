57\. Listen, I'm not saying he didn't have massive contributions, esp on the math side.

Just know too many AI bros (who I still love) who've said things like "We just need 50 Von Neumanns to build an AGI god and we're set"

No.

And he's not all that.

58\. The most important idea in Datomic is that there is no reason to overwrite data just because it changes.

It is more than a graph database, it is a graph database with a notion of time and history built in.

What was Joe's address as of Dec 2017?

59\. The main limitation of the EAV tuples (popular in Semantic Web land) is that you can't easily describe the relationships.

You get the FACTS, but it is a bit tricky to add information to those facts like "where did this info come from", or make statements like

If A then B

60\. To model human thought in a computable way you need to solve the problem in 59, you move closer to this goal if you give each "fact" or "edge" in the graph a unique identifier.

Long history of this in Associative Databases

Example in @RoamResearch

My shit posting on Eve has evoked the ire of @ibdknox, whose work I do greatly respect.

So will offer my more nuanced opinions on Eve and programming languages related to tools for thought, esp related to @RoamResearch and see if that gets me the last 40

61\. Designing a programming language - a medium for people to express their thought in a machine computable way is insanely hard.

Perhaps even harder to get the time and funding to do that level of deep work.

Exponentially harder to do on VC timescales.

62\. The fact that Chris and team were able to get venture funding AT ALL is an insane testament to the them, and quality of prior work /vision.

The fact that they got funding from some of the top investors in silicon valley put the project in historic category.

63\. Light-table (from Eve team) promised a smalltalk like IDE for devs using clojure or js

Easy access to docs, organize workspace by function not file, see values pass through

Huge potential for intelligence augmentation!

Easy switch for a userbase
