it takes a lot of work to figure out what's compelling to you, and then it takes even more work to figure out how to make it compelling to others

to do this you have to not only know yourself and the subject you care about ‚Äì you also have to know other people, their assumptions and expectations, you have to know the language that you're communicating in, and the medium that you're communicating in

the thing that always gets me is ‚Äì while this is hard, it's not impossible. there are several parts to the equation, but it's not infinite parts. you can study each of these things & get good enough at each of them in order to synthesize something that other people think is magic

As a fiction writer, this is a space I live in moment to moment. Paying attention to what excites and interests me right down to the individual gesture, the singular turn of phrase.

Stringing together a few thousand of these into a coherent whole is a majestic process.

It‚Äôs so true.

I have my 10 year ‚Äúovernight success‚Äù planned all but lined up ...

It‚Äôs just convincing myself to be patient enough, and stupid enough to think I can pull it off.
