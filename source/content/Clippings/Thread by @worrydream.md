100% agree with @MaxCRoser about limitations of stories. But stats are v. limiting too (e.g. Seeing Like A State) 1/

Stories & stats are two extremes, both myopic: one too specific, one too general. Neither can represent the truth of a complex situation. 2/

But stories & stats are relics of the paper medium. The dynamic medium allows a "ladder of abstraction" b/w them. 3/

I believe that the deepest understandings will come from a new form of "reading" which is actively moving up and down such a ladder. 4/
