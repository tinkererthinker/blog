I prefer to get 1 good reply from a thoughtful person than 1000 RTs with no meaningful engagement. and these days the RTs really don't seem to increase the odds of quality replies by much, and in fact near-guarantees low-effort low-quality replies

i think two things are true– I think (1) some aspect of this dynamic is near-universal with the acquisition of any kind of capital, and I also think (2) the climate on twitter lately has been particularly inhospitable, partially because of algo, partially bc of politics/vibes

the lesson in (1) is it's a bad idea to get too successful (too rich, too famous, even maybe too sexy) too fast– and here by too fast i mean before you've established filters, peers, etc to navigate the eventual onslaught of tedious bullshit that'll come your way

if you get too rich too fast it'll seem like everyone just wants to be friends with you because you're rich, because they want access to your capital, etc. this isn't 100% true, but by volume it'll be like >95% true, and managing that will be psychologically challenging

if at that point you become overtly grumpy and cynical etc you'll then drive away the 1% or 0.1% of thoughtful players, and then 'suffering from success' becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy

and it's often the case that the people who become successful in some dimension are usually the boldest players with the least self-doubt etc who had opportunity strike at the right time, and it's v difficult for those people in particular to suddenly switch to being nuanced

I think celebrities in the 2010s and 2020s are actually psychologically doing far better than their predecessors, imo in large part bc they have access to each other's DMs, so wiser voices can guide the newbies who are overwhelmed. one mentor who's been there can be all the diff

i've been fascinated by this topic for a long time– I think a question i've always had was, why don't we have a better class of public figure? i'll probably write an essay about it someday, but for now you get these periodic threads where i sorta sketch out a proto-form. ok gn

what's a recent post you'd like a good reply to?

**Visakan Veerasamy** @visakanv [2025-03-07](https://x.com/visakanv/status/1898060388652270060)

i don't really think about it like that... a good reply can come from anyone, in response to anything. it's about resonance between the post and the replier, which is particular to that \*relationship\*, not to the post

been saying for a while that the twt tl is just a wrapper for twt gcs. All the alpha is there

Tool to find mutuals-of-ur-mutuals would make this much more obvious

Also bringing circles back

i agree with the spirit of this, tho i'm also sort of naively earnest about wanting there to be 'gc-spiritedness in the open commons', for the weirdo outsider kids who don't have an intro (yet)

Micro blogging sites would be much better if they tended toward a few group chats rather than "small chance of virality"

twitter actually was more like that around 2013-2020 imo!

It seems to be a law that the quality of human interaction scales inversely with the number of participants.

generally true, though i believe exceptions are possible if it's carefully managed
