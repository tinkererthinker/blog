as a general rule I don't like to be sold things; earlier today a couple of girls came to my door to try and sell me some coupons for a new food delivery place. I'm like nah, I don't buy such things on the spot. they didn't leave me a pamphlet or anything tho. I like to read

I generally hate to try new apps of any kind. if you want me to try your app you have to go through an extremely lengthy process to persuade me. for context, conaw tried to sell me on roam for about a year at least and I ignored him the whole time until vgr started using it

if a mutual that I have a long history with has made an app, I would be compelled to try it for friendship reasons. or if they're someone who seems truly exceptional at what they do. but generally speaking I don't try new apps, even decent-ish ones. I'm a late adopter on this

the best way to get me to try something is to basically either find someone I really respect to talk about it (i downloaded hades after I saw patio11 praise it), or otherwise get about 3-4 different friends to mention it (queens gambit)

I generally don't like to get on calls with people or do demos or things like that. my preferred way of dealing with anything is to fiddle with it myself, and read relevant documentation if any

I like to buy extras of things that I like. I have a spare unopened mouse to bust out in case my existing mouse fails on me. I have multiple power banks.

I am generally v indifferent re: quality about things like pens, paper, etc â€“ I just like to have a lot of it lying around
