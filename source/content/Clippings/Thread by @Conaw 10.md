78\. You should not trust my opinion on Python.

The only reason I learned it at all was to write a few scripts on an open source Python IDE called Leo, which had cool way of organizing knowledge in a graph, again similar to @RoamResearch

79\. I have zero personal experience writing Erlang

However, I CAN tell you that

\- The What's App team built a $1B company with 11 engineers using it.

\- Joe Armstrong (a co-author) has some really incredible talks.

He even mentions Xanadu in this one

80\. The Elm language has had a massive impact on the front-end web

There is now so so much information about Redux on the web I can't find it, but original writeup from Dan Abramov on his inspirations for the architecture was a treasure trove, and he credited Elm for main ideas

81\. Programmers have accents

82\. Good Programming Languages are DEFINITELY NOT about "Thinking Like a Machine"

83\. Ivan Sutherland's "SketchPad" is what we should have

Ability to do direct manipulation to get to general area you want to go, and then ability to adjust code to normalize and get pixel perfect.

84\. If a project not having recent commits on github makes you immediately think you cant use it, there is something fundamentally wrong in your language community.

Code shouldn't rot.

85\. I haven't actually figured out how to use generative testing (test.check in Clojure, QuickCheck in haskell)

But when I do... and it generates millions of test cases my functions... I know in my soul it will be truly glorious

I'm so tempted to finish this out with Good Book / Bad Book opinions on learning various programming languages and be done, but I think I might pull a Venkat here and just wait till later in the week.

Ok, some hot takes on programming language learning material

86\. Yes, you can stitch together a huge amount of free online learning material to teach yourself a new language...

BUT

It will cost a huge amount of time and energy, and once there is a thing you KNOW you want to learn, it is often good to buy a course

87\. If you are on the bleeding edge of a new technology, or in an emergent language community, there will likely not be any courses available to hold your hand

This is the best guide on the web for teaching yourself rigorous academic subjects

88\. It is ok for a big chunk of your personal budget to go toward your own education -- and far far more cost and time effective to work outside of academia (DON'T GO TO GRAD SCHOOL)

There were months when I was in research mode where I spent about as much on books as on food.

89\. Textbooks are awesome. O'Reilly books are amazing.

The Joy of Clojure I remember as particularly good -- but I at least skimmed probably every Clojure book I could find once I really got into it.

Check "The Best Textbooks on Every Subject", buy one
