24\. Advances in programming languages reduce incidental complexity -- the complexity of talking with machines that doesn't relate to problems you're trying to solve.

Big advances: garbage collection/not having to worry about memory management, performant immutable datastructures

25\. Big ideas that shape whole languages have made their way into Clojure through libraries

The paper Communicating Sequential Processes inspired the creation of Golang (Go) -- very popular at google.

In Clojure, core.async library gives you all that!

26\. Bret Victor is right about direct manipulation generally.

Specifically: CSS is a flaming pile of garbage.

Messing with margins and padding to try to get a layout to look the way you want is 100% incidental complexity.

27\. Just parroting his quote from above talk

"So much of creativity is discovery, and you can't discover anything if you can't see what you're doing"

Similarly, programming languages should not only be conceived of as text or symbol based

28\. Getting beyond abstract symbols does not mean getting beyond abstract ideas.

The power of programming languages (and why you may want to learn them, even if not intent on building software) is that they let you get you hands dirty with building and using ur own abstractions.

29\. Cheating and linking an old thread

30\. Datalog is a much better query language than SQL, and will be more widely used than SQL in 2050

But might be only if you count people using natural language datalog, which will go mainstream in next 10 years

31\. Urbit is an interesting project, but won't actually take off unless/until someone writes an X -> Hoon or X -> Arvo or X -> "whatever" compiler because no one actually wants to think in Yarvis' pig latin.

32\. Hosted languages that provide nicer abstractions over the libraries from their host language have a huge huge advantage over new languages starting from scratch.

The ability to work with libraries from an existing/broader ecosystem is damn near table stakes for a new lang

33\. The world is a worse place because MIT switched from teaching LISP in the intro CS courses to teaching Python.

34\. If you haven't learned a programming language for a reason other than

A) It was a assigned to you in school

B) You thought it would make you money

Then I doubt your

a) curiosity

b) open-mindedness

and as a result

c) competency as a engineer
