having a fucking hilarious moment with myself where

i used to try and write an essay (Aardvark) and it never worked, dozens of failed drafts

decided to give up and write about something else (Beaver)

and then mentioned something from Aardvark in a footnote in Beaver...

that footnote (about Aardvark) is now swelling and growing and threatening to outweigh Beaver entirely, lmao

giving me another new angle to appreciate what i consider rich's best banger

funnily i actually do have a draft of an essay about this phenomenon too, about frame stories

it is really quite likely that Aardvark \*simply couldn't exist\* without the constraint of Beaver. at least within the constraint of my current writing abilities

I wonder if that's how House of Leaves emerged.

Like the author tried to write something, but then a footnote became big, way bigger than some other essays, then he thought: "hmm, I could write a book based on this idea"
