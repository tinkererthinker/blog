1\. tweet more

2\. do uncommonly good replies to high-follower accounts and viral tweets

3\. make your bio more pro-follower: say that you’re friendly and tell people what to talk to you about

4\. if a tweet gets you followers, RT + update it (thread) periodically

If someone follows you, how do you know if it was because:

\- read one of your tweets

\- read your bio

\- external follow link

you can never be 100% certain, but you can

1\. ask people what made them follow

2\. notice when a tweet’s engagement correlates with influx of followers

3\. notice changes in general rate of followers when you change your bio
