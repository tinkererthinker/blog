@balajis did you coin the term “network state”? Just heard it today from the quest digest.

It’s brilliant & captures the paradigm shift that excited me ten years ago when I first learned about #bitcoin, along with how the blockchain could play out - what we are seeing it now!

I first heard it circa ~2000 from lawyers interested in the way the internet could change governance models. People like Benkler, Castells etc. A search immediately turns up some writing from Castells around that time.
