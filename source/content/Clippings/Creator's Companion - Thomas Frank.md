## Stop Juggling Tools. Start Working Faster.

Tired of shoving ideas in Evernote, managing projects in Todoist, and tracking completed projects in Google Sheets? **Yeah, me too.**

![Creator's Companion home dashboard](https://thomasjfrank.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Creators-Companion-2.0-Demo-Shot-Full.jpg)

No more jumping between different tools for writing scripts, collecting ideas, and managing tasks.  Creator’s Companion is an advanced, expansive template that turns Notion into a **truly all-in-one tool** for managing your content creation process.

Capture ideas and prioritize the best ones, plan your editorial calendar, collect research, write scripts, analyze content performance, and even manage your brand deals from one place.

Plus, with optional integration with the **Ultimate Brain** template, you get a full-fledged task & project manager built into every content project.

**When your whole process happens in Notion, you work faster as a result.**

## This is the Tool I Use Myself.

![Thomas with Camera](https://thomasjfrank.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/36808713_463207364146602_8639946604238864384_n-1024x1024.jpg)

Hi, I’m Thomas Frank, and I’ve been a full-time YouTuber, podcaster, and blogger for more than 10 years.

Together with my team, I’ve built a YouTube channel with over **2.9 million subscribers** and **175 million views**, a blog with **600k monthly visitors**, and a long-running podcast.

In 2018, I stumbled across **Notion** after spending years juggling multiple apps to manage our content process.

Over time, we started using Notion for more and more – replacing other note-taking apps, task managers, and spreadsheets we used in the past. Today, we use Notion for the **entire** content creation process across 5 active web properties.

Creator’s Companion is the *exact* system my team and I use to manage all of our channels today. It’s the product of over three years of real-world use and testing.

"The Creator's Companion has been such a lifesaver for me! I used to have lots of lists, spreadsheets and notes filled with content ideas to unpack. Now it’s centralized, organized, and manageable thanks in large part with the help of this fantastic tool and Thomas’ guidance on how to use it."

## Go from Idea to "Published".

Creator's Companion helps you improve the **speed** and **efficiency** of your content creation process.

You'll find features and views that aid in idea capture, SEO, research & scripting, editing, publishing, and more.

## 💡 Capture Every Idea

Never lose an idea for a video or blog post. The Idea view lets you quickly capture and organize all of your content ideas.

If you haven’t worked on an idea in a while, it automatically goes to a safe archive. No more adding new ideas to a list three miles long.

[![Idea Tracker page](https://thomasjfrank.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Idea-Tracker-Creators-Companion-Template-for-Notion-1400x875.jpg)](https://thomasjfrank.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Idea-Tracker-Creators-Companion-Template-for-Notion.jpg)

## 🏆 Pick Better Topics

[![Idea Validation page](https://thomasjfrank.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Idea-Validation-Creators-Companion-Template-for-Notion-1400x875.jpg)](https://thomasjfrank.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Idea-Validation-Creators-Companion-Template-for-Notion.jpg)

The three keys to crafting a successful video are **title, thumbnail,** and **topic.**

The **best-performing** creators *validate* their ideas in each of these areas before investing time into them.

Less successful creators don’t do this, and they waste time on ideas that are fated to perform poorly.

Validation view helps you figure out which topics and ideas are worth the investment of your time and effort.

## 📋 Get Organized

Creator’s Companion helps you build a **content pipeline,** helping you stay on top of every project and publish **more** (while keeping your content quality high).

Project Manager view shows you the status of every project across all your channels, and lets you easily manage your **content** **calendar.**

[![Project Manager page](https://thomasjfrank.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Project-Manager-Creators-Companion-Template-for-Notion-1400x875.jpg)](https://thomasjfrank.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Project-Manager-Creators-Companion-Template-for-Notion.jpg)

## 📚 Build an Archive

[![Channel Archive showing finished video thumbnails](https://thomasjfrank.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Channel-Archive-Creators-Companion-Template-for-Notion-1400x875.jpg)](https://thomasjfrank.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Channel-Archive-Creators-Companion-Template-for-Notion.jpg)

Need to reference an old script? Want to see every video sponsored by a certain brand? Trying to remember when you took a certain piece of b-roll?

Other project management apps don’t do a good job at turning your finished projects into a **library.**

Notion excels at that job, and Creator’s Companion uses to Notion to add your finished projects to a useful archive.

"Your templates and channel are so immeasurably helpful! Especially for someone like me who recently found out I have ADHD and am trying to learn better skills to organize my life. Thanks for all your work and for sharing all your knowledge!"

## Tasks, Sub-Tasks, and Projects

Want to integrate your task management **directly** into your content planning?

![Tasks for a video project with due dates and assignees](https://thomasjfrank.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ultimate-Tasks-Integration-Creators-Companion-Template-for-Notion-1-1600x1270.jpg)

The upgraded **Tasks & Projects** version of Creator’s Companion fully integrates my **Ultimate Tasks** template. Every video, podcast, or blog post project gets a task view where you can add task (and sub-tasks).

These tasks will show up in your Inbox, Today, Next 7 Days, and other smart views. 

**Put simply, if you’d like to add tasks directly to content projects AND see them amongst all your other tasks, you’ll either want this version or the Ultimate Brain version! (see more about that below)**

"I just dove deep into the Creator’s Companion over the past few days, moving over projects and tasks, and it’s friggin’ epic. There’s a place for everything. THANK YOU."

## 🧠 Second Brain Integration

Want to tie your content planning into your second brain?

The **Ultimate Brain edition** of Creator’s Companion comes bundled with the popular Ultimate Brain template – my all-in-one second brain system for Notion.

Ultimate Brain lets you seamlessly manage tasks, notes, projects, and goals in Notion – and includes both GTD® lists and P.A.R.A. organization, *a la* Tiago Forte’s *Building a Second Brain.*

The bundle comes with a **fully integrated** version of both of both templates – meaning you’ll see all the notes and tasks you add to your content projects inside Ultimate Brain’s dedicated Note and Task dashboards.

Check out the video to learn more!

## Tutorials and Support

It's dangerous to go alone! Fortunately, you won't have to.

![Creators Companion Support Community](https://thomasjfrank.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Creators-Companion-Support-Community.jpg)

Creator’s Companion includes exclusive access to a private support community on Circle.

In the Tutorials section, you’ll find a full quick-start guide with videos showing you **exactly** how to set up your channels, capture ideas, and start producing content.

You’ll also find in-depth reference videos explaining every part of the template. I’m not marketing it as a Notion course, but it might as well be.

You can also get answers to your questions in our Support section, add suggestions for improvements, and swap ideas with fellow creators.

“As a musician, there are so many different projects and deadlines that I’m dealing with. Creator’s Companion takes a lot of guesswork out of how to plan for the release of a video, a piece of music, or any other kind of content.”

## What People Are Saying

Frequently Asked Questions:

Yes! After purchase, you’ll get an invite to our support community on Circle, which has an area that will allow you to upgrade to the Ultimate Tasks or Ultimate Brain by just paying the difference.

However, note that it’s not always easy to move from one copy of a Notion template to another. I do provide tutorials on how to do so, but you’ll have an easier time if you start with the version you truly want.

Nope! Everything in Creator’s Companion will work flawlessly on Notion’s free plan.

In Notion, any page can be made publicly available on the internet. It can also be set up so that others can duplicate it – i.e. add a copy of it into their own workspace.

Creator’s Companion is an expansive template which contains multiple pages and databases. 

When you duplicate Creator’s Companion into your own workspace, you’ll have an exact copy of it that you can then start using.

Absolutely. However, because this is a Notion template, you’re literally copying it into your own workspace.

This means that updates won’t automatically apply to your version of Creator’s Companion. For that reason, each update includes either or a **transfer guide** or **upgrade guide** that will show you how to transfer to a new copy, or upgrade your current copy of the template.

Absolutely! Creator’s Companion is a Notion template, which means it becomes yours the moment you add it to your workspace. From then on, you can make any tweaks that you want. *(Just please don’t share it with others, as it’s a paid template and part of my livelihood!)*

However, be aware that making changes to the template may make it harder for you to integrate any updates that I make to the template down the road.

When you buy Creator’s Companion, you’ll be automatically added to an exclusive Circle community where you’ll find tutorials and documentation. You’ll also be able to ask questions, make suggestions, and interact with me and other creators using Creator’s Companion.

Yes, 100%.

If you purchase via Notion’s marketplace, Notion entirely handles the payment.

If you purchase directly from us, transactions are encrypted and go through [Lemon Squeezy](https://www.lemonsqueezy.com/).

Either way, we never receive or see payment information.

If you’ve purchased through the Notion Marketplace, you can get a refund within 14 days of purchase. You can read more from their refund policy [here](https://www.notion.so/help/finding-templates-on-marketplace#request-a-refund).

If you’ve purchased through Lemon Squeezy or Gumroad, we have a 30-day refund guarantee. Within 30 days of purchase, email thomas@collegeinfogeek.com to ask for a refund.

*For Lemon Squeezy or Gumroad purchases, please send your email from the same email you used for purchase, or include your license key. One of these is needed to verify the original purchase.*

It depends.

Creator’s Companion makes it easy to manage multiple “channels” – my catch-all term for YouTube channels, blogs, podcast, and other publishing avenues.

You could very easily create channels for each client – or even copy the Sponsor database and create a Client database out of it.

However, you may hit a snag if you want to give a client access to all their projects in a central place. Creator’s Companion uses a central database for ALL your content projects. Right now, Notion does not provide a way to set permissions based on filtered database views – only for the **entire** database. 

You can get around this by keeping the whole database private, then manually sharing individual pages. But it’s not possible to share a “client” page with a Linked Database view that filters for their projects – you’d have to share the entire Content Tracker database with them, and that may not be ideal.

Of course, you could also simply duplicate the entire Creator’s Companion template as many times as you need, and give each client their own copy.

Yes – all digital products sold to non-business EU customers are required to include a VAT charge, and our payment processors automatically calculate this charge.
