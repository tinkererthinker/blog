This question is going to be a bit abstract of course because we all receive emotions differently. But the question in hand is how do I recreate the emotion in a chord progression.

I have been studying songs lately tryna find what chords are used in songs that move me and my friends finding what the role of each chord is ect..

The bit that gets me tho is how do you recreate the emotion found in these chords without it sounding the exact same.

For example: you and me the remix by flume uses in basic terms root,lead, dominant, lead throughout the track. But what info do I really take from this? If I say to myself well using 1,75,7 gives the emotion that I get from that song. How do I translate that into a new chord progression which doesn’t sound exactly the same.

The human feel is also something that heavily decides whether there’s emotion, OP if you’re pressing quantise then that’s ur problem. Emotion comes from the notes being played slightly out of time.

> > Yes I agree. Maybe you should try starting with a chord progression that has no attachment to a song you already know and see if you can add emotion to that, and if you get good at it, see if you can then come up with more than one way to express it emotionally. But having to decontextualize something you’re very used to and come up with something entirely new might be hard to do at first.

> What you need to understand is that chord progressions are not just emotions, but also the ebb and flow of tension. You can express similar emotions while still changing the places you put tense moments and their catharsis. You might find two of the chords that have a great emotional moment when the first becomes the second, and try putting them together but with a different harmonic rhythm, or putting different chords before/after them, or changing what your melody does over the top.

> Try humming to yourself.  
> You could try putting down your instruments, maybe even go to another room and just hum. Don't think too much, just vibe and hum. When you get it, record a voice memo of it on your phone or something, then reverse engineer it into whatever you imagine it to be. Chords, riffs, melodies etc..  
> I get my best ideas doing it in the shower, so have your phone just outside ready to go in case you forget the tune.

> Is it the chord change itself in the song that is creating the emotion or something in the vocal (melody, lyrics, delivery) or even something in the arrangement? There's nothing wrong with getting chord ideas from other songs, but I think trying to copy an exact moment or emotion is a bit of a fool's errand.
> 
> I think trying to break down exactly what causes you to feel the emotion in that moment and then creating your own moments with whatever chords/melody/arrangement is much more useful.

> Remember that there's not really such a thing as objective emotions of a song. The same song that you feel expresses sadness might be interpreted as anger by someone else. This applies to songs in general and to chord progressions especially. In isolation a chord progression doesn't convey anything else but the harmonic content. There's a bunch of other things that play in;
> 
> - Melody and lyrics
> - Tempo
> - timbre (Ie. What sounds you are using to play those chords)
> 
> And even then those are only the things that you can impact yourself. Your listener will also apply their subjective interpretation of these things according to a million different circumstances.
> 
> - what mood are they in?
> - what's the weather like?
> - what room are they in?
> - have they heard your style of music before?
> - do they have any memories attached to any of the specific sounds you are using? Etc etc
> 
> The best thing you can do is revert back to yourself. What is the story that YOU want to tell? What emotion are you feeling when you play your song? That is all that matters because you're not in control of the end interpretation at all.
> 
> Using functional analysis to try and make sense of the emotional impact of a chord progression is at best difficult since that's not really what such an analysis is trying to do.

> I just make it. Don't know, I don't think about music theory much in these moments, I just think about harmony and making it sound cool and not boring. Most of the time the synths inspire me for melodies. If sound is good, it will somehow make me create a melody for this sound. So I always crave for new synths and patches, I always tweak until I am fine. Sometimes when I listen to my tracks I just think "how did I make it?". Cause I always forget and start every project from scratch

> Harmonics/chords mimic the tone of the human voice and melodies mimic speech patterns which is how we express emotions. Spend time developing your ear for chords/melodies and your emotional openness to music. Practically, spend time looking up chords/melodies for songs you emotionally feel and try to play at least a basic version on midi keyboard so you develop a feel for what the chords are for the music and how they are interacting. You will start to notice trends that you can learn to apply without just outright copying.

> A chord progression by itself creates , no emotion. Is the whole arrangement of the song that helps build up emotion and this mainly has to do with arrangement, perception , sound design and talent. Sound design is mostly more identifiable in movies but knowing how it s done can help around with music. Imagine that you are a director of movie that only blind people are going to watch. You will have to use music and sounds to let them "see" what s going on. So the arrangement of your music is what is going to do that , not that chord progressions. When it comes to emotions from sounds what plays a major role are the frequencies rather than the notes/chords.

> It sounds cheesy but it’s so true-write from the heart. Think of something that makes you emotional in some way and then play around with your instrument of choice until something matches that. It’s not going to happen in four seconds, so be patient. It’s good to detach from the DAW, or paper, or phone notes during this. Just play and play and then well, yeah maybe get it down on your phone’s voice recorder when you have something but then detach again until you’re really ready to track it. Don’t overthink it and have fun!
