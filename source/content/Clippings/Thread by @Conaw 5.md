35\. There are two problems for programming languages to solve

1) Performance on machines

2) Usefulness as a tool for thought

Right now those are complected -- Intentional Software was doing something interesting toward separating those two out

36\. \*\*Technical people\*\* are just people who "try to understand"

Killing conversations with "I'm not technical" is a dangerous practice that will hurt you (and those around you) in the long run.

37\. Your type system won't save you

38\. Provably correct doesn't mean it works

39\. Contracts and gradual typing > strong types

40\. Many people with 10 years of experience in software engineering haven't actually grown or learned much in that time.

They've done the same first year 10 times on repeat.

Polyglots generally avoid falling into this pattern.

41\. Reagent (A Clojurescript wrapper around React) is way easier to read, write, and maintain than vanilla react.

42\. Dan Abramov has said that Redux is not a javascript clone of Re-frame (the CLJS framework for writing SPAs in react), it is just that both were inspired by elm and arrived at similar pattern...

But even so... Re-frame was first and still much better in almost every way

43\. The Re-frame documentation is most informative/entertaining read-me on github

https://github.com/day8/re-frame/blob/master/README.md…

44\. Clojurescript is an EXCELLENT choice for consumer or SaaS internet startups.

If you are starting a new company and can afford it, you should spend invest a few months in learning it first and building in it vs your normal stack, will pay huge dividends over time.

45\. A great engineer can learn Clojure well enough to be productive in under a month.

46\. Setup for react development (Webpack/Babel/100 other tooling things) was a dumpster fire in 2015.

It's probably still bad.
