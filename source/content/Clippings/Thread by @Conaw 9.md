70\. After Eve raised VC, appeared to me to take a hard reset approach to try to make programming level capability available to complete beginners

Inventing new UIs, new language, and new database - based on Dedalus

Incredible engineering lift that I would def not be capable of

71\. When I say they went off the rails, really means they took a strategy that I didn't agree was a good one / was aesthetically opposed to.

But they weren't on my track

I was living in India at the time, lurking on their list serv, building prototypes of @RoamResearch

72\. The prototypes of Eve I found most compelling where the ones that were more like a semantic Tiddlywiki with a natural language query engine.

I liked the ideal of Excel power applied to notes

Building full apps/games felt way out of scope to start

73\. To be fair, I think I share a lot of @ibdknox's long term vision.

The big point of departure is that I don't think most "non-programmers" enter the world building games.

I'd rather help them build explorable/interactive models of the world.

74\. On this point, there is another caveat I'll add to my OO shitposting in points 3 & 4.

I still hate Ruby (my first language) for web-dev, but Modelica is great example of how the principles make a ton of sense for modeling systems.

75\. Similarly -- I think there are a ton of great ideas in Analytica for building quantitative models of systems

Problem there is the tool has like a $1,000 license and only works on Windows.

Mostly just used in places like the Defense Department.

76\. You don't actually know a language until you've built something substantial with it.

Substantial is relative to what you've built before.

Often in new languages we start by trying to follow paradigm we're used to.

Anyone saying I don't know my shit is probably correct.

77\. Disclosures:

I've built web apps with users (at least two!) in

\- Ruby

\- Javascript

\- Javascript during a Haskell inspired phase where I did everything with Ramda.js and all my shit was curried and point free

\- Clojurescript

Ramda is super fun imo
