**Math Academy** @\_MathAcademy\_ [2024-06-19](https://x.com/_MathAcademy_/status/1803228367065645086)

Our Methods of Proof course is finally ready!

http://mathacademy.com/courses/methods-of-proof…

This course introduces students to proof-writing essentials, bridging the gap between pure problem-solving and constructing formal mathematical arguments. Students will formalize their understanding of logic, sets, and functions while delving into new concepts such as congruence, relations, and cardinality. It consists of 138 individual topics and is roughly equivalent to a semester-length course in terms of the quantity of material covered.

Any student who completes MoP before university should feel a seamless transition into serious math-major courses such as real analysis, abstract algebra, and number theory as opposed to the massive shock and overwhelm that typically occurs.

I'm excited to announce that @\_MathAcademy\_'s Discrete Mathematics course is now live and available for registration!

The course description and other details are below.

Do I need to go through the 3 Foundation courses to take this? I’d prefer to try this from the get-go if possible, or go through only through the relevant prerequisites

You should start with Methods of Proof if you haven't already done that.

If you're confident in Mathematical Foundations I, then you're safe to take the Methods of Proof diagnostic and have the system serve you the Foundations II and III prerequisites as part of this course (the diagnostic test currently looks two courses back in the course graph).

If you're not confident in Mathematical Foundations I, I strongly advise you to take that first.

The first student to jump on our Methods of Proof course, which is the equivalent of a semester-length university course, is already 89% of the way through it, and he only started it 6 weeks ago on May 22nd. (The darker the shading of the topic, the more stable the knowledge.)
