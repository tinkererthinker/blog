my belief: there's never been a maxed out person. we've never seen it happen. they've never existed. name whoever is your all time GOAT 'maxed out person', von neuman or einstein or whatever. they could've done even more/better if they had better support

I think maxed out is also an inaccurate framing. Humans donâ€™t have skills and abilities like RPG characters. We forget most of what we read, our habits that were once helpful become detrimental with enough time, our skills quickly lose usefulness in a changing world. We become overconfident after success and it can make us worse.

We are not a skill tree. We are temporary flows of energy, which might happen to line up with some opportunity for some brief flicker of time, and then we disappear.

along with this, technology augments our abilities and compensates for the ones we lack

There cannot be a maxxed out human because these technologies will keep pushing the frontiers of what is possible
