I love music with all my life. It’s the only thing that gets me going. I’m even takin theory classes to learn how music works, I’m studying music. Been playing instruments and music for almost 12 years.

But that’s besides the point. I recently found multiple songs that made me feel emotions I felt before but It reacted in such a way I’ve never experienced. I had chills go up my spine, my hands shook from the amount of pleasure I was hearing in the harmonies, chords, etc. I even cried cuz the feeling was so surreal. I closed my eyes and for what it felt like 50 seconds I was in a whole other place. It’s hard to explain but the feeling was something so strong I almost don’t wanna feel it again but I do. I never ever felt this before

I’m probably crazy explain this but I need to know if anyone else felt this

It's one of his squelchy odd ones and then he just drops the beauty on you for a goddamn second. It takes me over. His music is like that, full of contrast, harshness and beauty side-by-side, sometimes at the same time.

I remember after the first build up when the drums come in, I literally had waves of pleasure pulsing through my body. I'd like to ask, what song were you listening to that got this reaction out of you?

I recently tried listening to it on acid and started crying and every emotion just kinda hit me at once in full force. The ending of it specifically.... fuck

> I used to feel like that a lot. When I was like 16-18 I’d listen to music every night for hours at loud volumes through headphones. I noticed after getting into a certain state about 25 minutes into listening it was just like pure pleasure while the songs were on. I listened to a lot of loud guitary noise rock and dreamy stuff. Eventually I started taking drugs to enhance this. For a while that was the most beautiful thing I can imagine. Then I went too far and never came back. Music is much less physically pleasing now. Every once in a while it will hit me but it’s much different. Now a passionate line or incredible phrasing brings out an intensity in me.

> 1000%. I've performed live and even played things I had no idea I knew how to do – even things that I can't repeat later on command if I wanted to. It's almost as I trascend and the spirit of music takes over my body when I allow it (no overthinking, just enjoying the ride). Crazy sounding I know but it's the closest thing to a "religious" experience I've ever had, and it's beautiful to give yourself over to it.

> I think this is a strong reason why movies use music the way they do – to punctuate emotions, to enhance meaning. A scary scene is so much scarier with tense music, as a happy or melancholic scene can feel so much more uplifting or tear-jerking with the right music. It just carries so much emotional power, it's like a drug haha...

Without music it felt kind of meaningless - you assume it could be the man's balloon but also - whatever, who cares? The man didn't seem to care either way.
> > >

Next example, same clips but with quirky upbeat music - you didn't feel pain, you felt humor - changed the meaning entirely of how the man may have felt, like he may have let the balloon go out of joy. And so on like this. It's pretty cool how music can enhance or create meaning where there is none or where it's not strong enough on its own!

> For me, the most recent was Lights Out by Zeds Dead, which is sort of funny because I'm not huge on electronic music. Been going through this weird growth phase where I'm kind of figuring out who I am and what I want out of life again, and that song has this hard undertone of ambiguity. It's almost sad but hopeful, happy but bittersweet, it's really hard for me to nail down just what it is. That resonates with me like hell right now with this odd state I've been in, hits me like a brick every time I listen to it.

> Yeah, whenever I listen to any kind of music. I'm always getting pleasure for that. And I always shake my head when I listen to any music. Probably, it's due to my temperament, but I love shaking my body when I chill out and listen to music.

> I feel this emotion so strongly brother, all the time. I truly believe music is one of those unifying arts because it draws on so much of people's intrinsic experiences. You're lucky to have found music that resonates with you so deeply. Enjoy it, and hope to replicate that feeling for other people. 🙏
