two ideas:

1\. We're still in the 2000s, MIT opencourseware hasn't yet existed for 1 full generation. Education is a meme whose success takes 1 generation, at least.

2\. No need to be depressed, just create new schools w/ ur friends to trigger the golden age faster. 😁

An alternate perspective, dependin' on your spirits

But also, let's take a look at what is silently happening, being mostly unreported, but which every single kid will know in the new education paradigm, when it arrives (which obviously means when you teach it to them)

Hmm 🤔

So it seems a small number of world-class athletes currently credit YouTube for their success.

Will your kid? Will you? Hard to say, exactly.

It's important to remember that a lot of the great societies we look up to had to be founded by a small group of paradigm-shifting deviants who failed over and over trying what would later appear extremely obvious.

Like scientific society, for instance

If you started a "YouTube university" today, that was entirely built upon a foundation of practical + enjoyable open knowledge, focused on educating small groups of existing friends who want to make something of themselves...

How many years would it take to succeed?

There are people out here interested in being the deviants who find a way to build a wiser, stronger society, in public. You can just reply to them, anytime.

They might even be reading this thread 🤫

Of course, Erik Hoek himself has written wonderfully on the subject

I can see the miracles and unexpected flourishing of the early years of a golden age that historians will say started two decades ago.

Can you?

Sports may be a bad model for human progress and flourishing, as a finite/zero-sum/well-structured game category.

http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/GameTheory

sports aren't my model for human progress or flourishing (though they aren't zero-sum at all, b/c they serve a purpose within an infinite, positive-sum social game called society, but i digress)

gold-medal athletes are model students, because they had to learn to be the best.

in other words, my point in bringing up sports is not "you too, dear reader, should become an athlete"

it's "well, if the best athletes in the world are learning how to be the best by self-teaching from youtube, then dang, YouTube must be a pretty interesting technology."
