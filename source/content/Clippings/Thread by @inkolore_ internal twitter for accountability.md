I now understand that all my struggles to get things going over a long time is because I don't have a supporting network of people to create with and talk to about creative stuff.

What I really long for is a sort of network of parallel play/work, where I can do stuff knowing

@DefenderOfBasic @workflowsauce

Maybe Im just noticing this now because im aware of it, but there seems to be a growing trend of this. People looking to share/work on their ideas and projects in a more personal community(aka not the broad scope of twitter)

Ive been mulling over this idea for the past couple days after the things we discussed defender.

An open source community of ideas/'The Book' seems to be the way forward, the hurdle mostly is how to best action it. personally and on a community level.(as far as I can tell)

I was thinking, should we make a thread collecting ideas and suggestions for going forward? it could also be a point of focus to direct people towards in the meantime.

I don't know if you're including me in the conversation but I'd love to hear what you have to say/write about this.

My general observation is the following: there is a sort of entropy to relationships where not talking to strangers is the default state

> Friendships have an entropy to them (I guess everything does?) because they are an unlikely state: by default you are a stranger to people and it takes work to be friends, and especially to \*maintain\* the relationship.

therefore people tend to remain strangers with one another (duh)

The 2 main directions to solve this are:

1) Exert effort, which is unreliable and a bit scary

2) Build places with a sort of identifiable core that people can gravitate around and meet one another, without having to go through "raw meeting", i.e. meeting someone you don't know at all, and instead have sort of a \*context\* around which the relationship emerges from Is really the only sustainable way to have relationships, maybe there are other options but it's a basic distinction

I agree fully.

This is sort of what Im thinking about, how to actionably create spaces/paradigms people can easily integegrate into a community through.

Especially in online space, maybe not everyone feels this way, but I personally struggle to socially connect with people online

creating an open community doesn't have to happen in a single site/space I dont think. Rather as long as you have points of focus for newcomers to easily onboard and connect then youre mostly sorted

Sorry to hijank your original post for this tangent a bit @inkolore\_ .

To focus in a more actionable and direct point. You're welcome to DM me for feedback/discussions around any projects/ideas youve got going if youd like.

I'm going to DM you by tonight for my time (it's 10AM as I post this)

I need a bit of time to sort out what I want to do in terms of \*scale\*, but maybe even "scale" is the wrong way to think about it.

But anyway I'm sorting some thoughts for myself and I'm reaching out soon!

Awesome! thats not bad because im in a similar time zone to you then(9am)

Don't feel too pressured about how to structure things or how deep to start off. Just opening up channels for communication is the first step

Yeah I did intend on simply tweeting way more about this, and host twitter spaces too, but the basic hang up I get is like ... what do I write/talk about?

The need is obvious: creating stuff in your own corner is not very fun and isn't sustainable, but what does better look like?

**Rhetorical Sophist** @DaoistEgo [2024-08-13](https://x.com/DaoistEgo/status/1823272896648659243)

What ive come to realize is that ideas dont exist as isolated points in your perception, rather a network

though sometimes you can distil them down into a phrase/statement, theres a lot of context loss when theyre disconnected from the network

I dont know if this is the case with you, but when I try to communicate an idea, the struggle is not that I dont know what to talk about, its that I dont know how to talk about my ideas without also providing essays of context so the idea isn't miscommunicated or illegible.

So your options are to drip feed context through something like your twitter account and hope people are keeping score, or produce large bodies of work that exhaust every facet.

Both have large drawbacks of their own

So I think this is where @DefenderOfBasic 's ideas come in. to try create community spaces that sit in the middle.

The thing about relationships sounds super interesting! I think this is why I'm so drawn to this open source model. Or everyone having a "works in progress" blog/GitHub repo.

![Image|400](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GU236LgWYAEjgLl?format=jpg&name=large)

Like, it helps a lot when I articulate what I'm working on to find others who are doing it too. But it's also a lot of work. But if I am working in the open by default it lowers the barrier

Twitter is my global slack room. My default relationship to everyone now is "coworker"

So, still strangers, emotionally, by default. But I assume everyone is working alongside me for the same employee (spaceship earth). Not everyone realizes they have a job to do, but we're all here

This is great because it provides a framework for people to connect without needing to cognitively strain themselves with intimately connecting to everyone they interact with online.

Yes yes yes! I can't be friends with that many people. But I can be coworkers. Inside big tech, we had internal slacks, and such. I bet companies can do this too..internal twitter, help people collaborate and create more. Big tech is extremely siloed and it hurts them
