i remember walking around the streets of sf feeling like the king of the world. random women would compliment me on my clothes and jewelry, which I think permanently levelled up my self-esteem, an effect which persisted even when I got back home

I think Miles Davis described something similar as a black American man in France. not to imply that our experiences are directly similar. but I think the generalizable thing is: a significant amount of your self-image, etc might be part of a feedback loop with your environment

the experience of "wow, people are interested in me!" is something that you can carry with you even after you return to your boring ol' hometown. it's a lil hero's journey: you leave your comfort zone and discover a new dimension of yourself

oh, and I wear a lot more jewelry now, which solves the hotel anxiety. I clearly look like some kind of main character everywhere I go now, nobody questions this. &I don't think I'd have had the guts to do it until I travelled first. so it's proof-of-work

I was thinking about this just today, main-character-camouflage. Or, trying to be philosophical about my desire for insane winter coats.
