One of our students recently completed 125 learning tasks in a single day! ðŸ¤¯

104 lessons, 8 quizzes, 10 reviews, 3 multisteps, 1156 XP in total, and close to 1,000 questions. They also earned bonus XP on 7 out of 8 quizzes.

Try doing that with Khan Academy.ðŸ˜‰

But Khan Academy is literally free.

I wanted to illustrate one of the differences between KA and us.

No other resource on the planet will deliver this kind of learning efficiency. It took years to develop the content and tech to make this possible. This is why we're not free.

Although we're not free, we also deliver more "bang for the buck" than any other paid resource on the planet. [https://x.com/abarrallen/status/1830022387586445729â€¦](https://x.com/abarrallen/status/1830022387586445729) 

But if money is tight, Khan Academy is a good option.

For a student preparing for some exam,time is more expensive than money.
