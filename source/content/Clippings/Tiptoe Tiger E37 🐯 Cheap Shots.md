We should engage in more rogue civics projects. Why should the government have all the fun?

A few weeks ago, a man in San Francisco attached a metal box with a solar panel containing an Android phone to a pole in the Mission in San Francisco. The phone was set to Shazam 24/7 and publish the results to [this website, Bop Spotter.](https://walzr.com/bop-spotter)

Sadly, the box stopped working on October 7th and only a few days of the Shazam results are still accessible. As a bright idea, I still wanted to share it.
