Just another example of the Myth of the Objective. Maximization does not lead to greatness.

Maximizing the right objective (impact) works; maximizing the wrong objective (h-index) does not

Unfortunately maximizing impact usually means plugging away at the same problem over many years, which you will not get funded unless you put out intermediate (ie weak) results

But explicitly trying to maximize impact will not lead to the highest impact. Thatâ€™s the objective paradox. The highest impact comes from not worrying about impact and doing something interesting to you.
