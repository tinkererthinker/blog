I have a hunch that many/most people interested in the "network state" are primarily motivated by a desire to reverse their sense of atomisation & alienation...

statecraft seems a really weird response to those problems. what am I missing here??

im interested in organization to solve collective problems like paying for basic healthcare that is rooted in opt in rather than threat of violence

very different than alienation

I am interested in that too. my approach is to practice at small scale and then gradually build legitimacy for large scale change. inventing a new state seems like a wacky red herring at best or an abdication of civic responsibility at worst

I like the network state idea so much I'm creating one myself. It's called Autonomous United, and I'll be telling people about it and encouraging the right people (like yourself!) to apply for the first time at the Network State Conference on Monday October 30th.

cool to hear you are working on this

i agree that extremism is not the approach here and its not something ive invested in much but

it does seem the right road is to build specialized "co-ops" from the ground up

whether this is a state or not, \*shrug\*

it seems to me like most of them want more control over things because they feel like they have the answers, and for various reasons believe it would be better to make a network state than do any civic engagement with their current state

I am surprised if anyone has done a bunch of political organising and then concluded what we need is a new state. I understand if people choose to refocus their politics on different scales, or ditch electoralism, but inventing a new polity is a head scratcher

I don't think you're missing anything, "state" is the wrong meme for these projects

I am more interested in network dinertable and network neighbourhood... maybe all the scales can fit together and play nice

---

**Jon Hillis (,,)** @JonathanHillis [2023-10-26](https://x.com/JonathanHillis/status/1717597312732864629)

yep, that's exactly the scale Cabin plays at—dinner tables and neighborhoods. you get enough of those happening locally across a global network, and we call that a network city.

**brooke bowman** @gptbrooke [2023-10-26](https://x.com/gptbrooke/status/1717604700210831599)

and currently most of them do seem to be playing nice

cabin, fractal, and vibecamp are all going to be represented at the conference (it'll be my first time ever speaking at one of these shindigs 😱)

I think it's largely disagreeing with the circumstances of your birthplace and wanting to find autonomy with like-minded folks regardless of physical location.

**Richard D. Bartlett** @RichDecibels [2023-10-26](https://x.com/RichDecibels/status/1717635847883743547)

and we need new states for this?

interesting take. the "network state" allure might be a search for belonging in our digital age.

while statecraft might seem an unusual remedy to atomisation, maybe it's about crafting new, dynamic spaces of connection?

reimagining community in a fragmented world. but, it's a

**Richard D. Bartlett** @RichDecibels [2023-10-27](https://x.com/RichDecibels/status/1717805794937446811)

yes that is basically the game I am playing. but statecraft seems like a wacky red herring

**Niran Babalola** @niran [2023-10-26](https://x.com/niran/status/1717600946950218023)

"fraternal order" is too old fashioned and "cult" has negative connotations, so a new framing for high-demand groups is actually useful

---

**Richard D. Bartlett** @RichDecibels [2023-10-26](https://x.com/RichDecibels/status/1717635620732850522)

there's a long long way from fraternal order to state though?

To me it seems an exodus strategy for crypto/digital nomads. Escape bad places while maintain clout in the form of digital passport that provides rights and protections. Large corporations like Amazon will likely take the form of a network state, maybe shedding the blockchain.

It's a useful if inaccurate meme to bat signal all the people who recognize the incapability of current states/governments to navigate the Anthropocene.

On the one hand, large online communities — any large community — will inevitably require some of the mechanisms of states.

On the other hand yeah buddy this is not going to fix your loneliness.

**Richard D. Bartlett** @RichDecibels [2023-10-26](https://x.com/RichDecibels/status/1717635945095209129)

perhaps we could use some of the existing states for this

ah, but i am interested in it because i observe the ongoing collapse of traditional nation-states as organizing bodies for society

perhaps these are the same picture?

**Richard D. Bartlett** @RichDecibels [2023-10-26](https://x.com/RichDecibels/status/1717593735335145896)

by what measures are states collapsing? isn't it extremely contested space?

State-craft implies fixity that I don’t think network state necessarily requires, project might be more like authoring principles, lore, flexible software, etc.

To be honest it took me a while to figure out this was my motivation. “Network state” helps w overcoming that, and also self-alienation that was maybe the core issue. Once I worked that out my interest became more utilitarian.

I think on some level it connects with the microsolidarity idea. We need irl bonds with other humans, but we also need big projects and an inspiring vision that lots of people can align with in a decentralized way. In this case, the vision is of a new less violent post

It’s misguided in its attempt to start with a heterogenous digital enclave & move into physicality. Pluralism is a necessary component States. I think it mostly comes from a desire to fork the legacy state due to systemic failure of means of redress to mod the system internally.
