Ok one day I may regret I hadn't written anything about it so today I'll write a bit about it.

I don't want fame. \*insert Tim Ferris article\*. I don't want richness â€” I can do most of what I want on 30k/y probably. ==I do want to be Known tho, I do want to be Seen.==

Known for the things I build, would be a good outcome. I don't want to be known by everyone (again, I don't want fame). One good outcome would be to have an impact over thousands, even hundreds of thousands of people... Who don't know me at all, but appreciate what I've created.

> Being known by a (somewhat small) % of those that \*really\* appreciate what I've done, that is what I am looking for. I want those who appreciate the creation to know me and know that I was the one that did that.

If there is one thing I want out of life is that (some) people know and appreciate that I created something out of nothing. Hopefully something creative, original, special. Something good. Undoubtedly good.

I want to have the Freedom to Create and to be fortunate enough to be able to provide for others the same opportunity.

For this I would need more than 30k/y. The more fortunate I am the more slack I get to pay it forward to others and propagate this spirit.

After a certain threshold, I think I want all my income to be routed for this mission. First I need to take care of myself, and then... Then I can take care of others.

This is important to me, I didn't use mission by happenstance, I really mean it.

I said hundreds of thousands b4, bc I don't want scale to scare me. If that happens so be it. But that ain't the goal, might be an happy accident if some of my creations end up being a Hit. But it doesn't need to be hundreds of thousands. Having good impact on 100 ppl is enough.

Oh and I want to be known, in part, by The Way I Act. This shall be one of my Creations! It is a work in progress, tho. I don't like all of my ways yet, there's wounds to heal. It is important to me that the blood of my wounds do not taint the spirit of others.

In this particular Creation, the Freedom to Create can be detrimental. It is a CoCreation; there is no other way around it, and that's good actually.

This is why I want to take care of others, it's kinda like graduating from the single-player game into the multi-player game.

There's a whole bunch of other levels to explore when you play the multi-player long game.

And exploration is important to me. Freedom is in part non-limitations from Others, non-pressures from Others. Freedom is being allowed to shape & nurture your Self the way you feel naturally inclined to, being allowed to spiritually find yourself in the purest way possible.

And when you find yourself, there you are. There you are! There is no possible way to pressure you, to limit you. Because you Know. You Know Who You Are. That is what it is to be known, and to be known first you need to know yourself. Your spirit, your nature.

You need freedom to get there. You need slack. And some get none of it. How fucking cruel?! This is why I want to take care of others after I stabilize my position. I got plenty of freedom, I got plenty of slack!

And those weren't free! They had a high cost! I know because I tasted the blood of the wounds that those battles created. And I was lucky... For the cost I tasted on that blood was a mere distilled sample of the cost the wounded had to pay!

I want to be able to do the work I am meant to do, and to pay it forward. :)

Pay it forward 10x more, 100x more... Shall the sky be the limit. ðŸ¥°ðŸ˜‡

(well... You know what? I am already v happy I wrote this!! I do wonder how much of this will get lost in translation... But that's fine, I can write about it another day, another way... But this one is here and I love it)
