No. And I'm also not a capitalist. Both are 20th century ideologies. (And they are words that have been stretched and abused to the point of meaninglessness: remember, in the 1990s, Microsoft called Linux "communist": [www.theregister.com/2000/07/31/m...](https://www.theregister.com/2000/07/31/ms_ballmer_linux_is_communism/ "https://www.theregister.com/2000/07/31/ms_ballmer_linux_is_communism/") ) I support freedom, global equality of opportunity, kindness and cooperation, human welfare and progress. These are timeless principles. The question is how to use the tools we have available to achieve these values in the context of the 21st century. I've written at length about the kinds of mechanisms I personally support, but I definitely do not think that I am the only source of good ideas, I think figuring out the best approach is a shared project of both thinking and also increasingly real world experimentation.

Also when you say freedom do you mean individual liberty or do you mean liberation from institutional oppression of classes

[![Vitalik Buterin avatar](https://wrpcd.net/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/BXluQx4ige9GuW0Ia56BHw/341d47e1-f746-4f5c-8fbe-d9e56fa66100/anim=false,fit=contain,f=auto,w=288)](https://warpcast.com/vitalik.eth)

Some of both. Liberation from institutional oppression, without individual liberty, is imo too easily turned into a slogan to justify new forms of institutional oppression Individual liberty without liberation from institutional oppression too easily slides into forms of oppression that leave people alone in a purely formal sense but are still highly extractive

Hard agree re tools/mechanisms. I'm quite fond of relational ethics as a guiding framework for new technologies, esp coordination technologies. The literature is still very theory based (not a bad thing) but there are some practical mechanisms emerging eg. to improve plurality in llm trainingsets and rlhf[![ü¶í avatar](https://wrpcd.net/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/BXluQx4ige9GuW0Ia56BHw/34aab6e6-015f-4363-98c4-a4abafecb800/anim=false,fit=contain,f=auto,w=288)](https://warpcast.com/srijan.eth)

This kind of question is tricky as you don‚Äôt know what communism or capitalism means from their perspective. These terms have become distorted and taken on many different meanings in the process of dissemination and interpretation. so when you mentioned the C word earlier, many people might have understood it differently from how you intended, leading to an amplification of misunderstandings based on their misconceptions. Therefore, it‚Äôs wiser and more desirable to emphasize specific principles rather than any ‚Äú-ism.‚Äù No one should be bound or hijacked by an ideology; instead, they should pursue concrete values.[![Erik avatar](https://wrpcd.net/cdn-cgi/image/anim=false,fit=contain,f=auto,w=288/https%3A%2F%2Fi.seadn.io%2Fs%2Fraw%2Ffiles%2Fad549379a71c7948b405e10d84e5e7b7.png%3Fw%3D500%26auto%3Dformat)](https://warpcast.com/eriks)

Yeah but that's also known as socialism, why can't we just use the word for it that we've been using? Because some people have negative associations with it due to propaganda... But the ruling class will do that for anything that threatens them. Call it something new but if it threatens the plutocrats they'll make sure it's demonized just like "Socialism" and "Communism"[![Paulith avatar](https://wrpcd.net/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/BXluQx4ige9GuW0Ia56BHw/e5c3f2d4-aff1-4090-d6e9-8d8b94b5f800/anim=false,fit=contain,f=auto,w=288)](https://warpcast.com/paulp.eth)[![Catabolismo avatar](https://wrpcd.net/cdn-cgi/image/anim=false,fit=contain,f=auto,w=288/https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FBPelwCj.jpg)](https://warpcast.com/catabolismo)
