If youâ€™re under 35 try consider replacing all resolutions with equivalent make-more-money resolutions.

Examples:

Exercise more = +10k for a 3x/week personal trainer

Eat better = +10-60k more for eating out at salad places/exec chef

Learn stuff = +5k-15k for personal coach

Solving problems with money is more efficient in proportion to how much you value your mental effort resources for other stuff you enjoy more. If those activities pay on a leveraged way, the trade off is 100% worth it.

Why under 35? Because concentrating your mental resources on your [[comparative advantage]] creates a kind of high-drive exhausting raw energy positive feedback loop that Iâ€™ve only seen younger people handle well. And that loop is what creates the surplus to pay for other stuff.

The older you are the greater the financial surplus you need to achieve the same level of attention concentration on a core positive feedback loop. Money is a more achievable kind of leverage when youâ€™re younger though you need it more badly when youâ€™re older.

Iâ€™d need a million dollars today to achieve level of leverage I could have gotten with 100k in 2010. This is why for the average person, financial leverage drops with age. But we fixate on CEOs and entrepreneurs who buck that trend by making $-leverage faster than they are aging.

For financially average people like me, you fall behind on that game, and solving problems with money stops being an option, because youâ€™re not efficient enough as a cost structure to achieve much with the surplus you have. So do it while you still can.

Counterintuitive but yes. That exec attention is more cdluable elsewhere when young and itâ€™ll take a bigger, out-of-reach surplus to achieve similar reallocation efficiency when youâ€™re older. Plus doing it when young installs stronger habits for later.

tldr get rich young if you can. Itâ€™s both easier and more valuable.

In your experience, does earning more generally correspond to having less free time or energy to pursue these tasks? Or is it the case that you need to sacrifice these goals short term so that you have more freedom in 5-10 years?

Having more money young changes your goals and who you are. Itâ€™s not a zero-sum tradeoff analysis. Your money history is as big a part of your growth story as health or relationships and way bigger than explicit philosophy. The only question is do you want to become that person.

This is very interesting given my age. Can you please say more?

It's better to earn 10K more so I can afford personal trainer, instead of forgoing the income and trying to do exercise by myself?

I love this way of looking at things. At the same time, thereâ€™s an inherent privilege assumed in this advice, considering that the average Millennial that this advice targets isnâ€™t in a financial position to take this advice. Source> http://shorturl.at/hjvJ1

Iâ€™ve written off the average millennial. Iâ€™m high-grading my bets here.

Reminds me of Sandbergâ€™s Lean In advice around getting the better childcare to take the next career ladder step which will pay for the extra care and more. There is some baggage with her arguments, so it is good to be explicit about the conditions for when this is a good idea.

This argues get rich to consume better.

Counterargument: get rich to buy your freedom by early retirement.

Whatâ€™s it worth to you in terms of giving up (essentially STATUS) consumption to have full control of your life from age 40 or age 50 onward?
