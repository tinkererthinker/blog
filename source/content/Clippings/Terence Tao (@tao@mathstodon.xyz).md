Michael Nielsen has kindly hosted a backed up version of the Polymath wiki, which had gone offline: [michaelnielsen.org/polymath/in](https://michaelnielsen.org/polymath/index.php?title=Main_Page "https://michaelnielsen.org/polymath/index.php?title=Main_Page"). It is not in a form suitable for subsequent editing, but is at least a historical record of past Polymath projects. (I would imagine that any future Polymath project would likely proceed with a more modern collaboration platform, such as a Github repository.)
