begging engineers who are very good at debugging to understand that the same exact meta-skill can be used on people. You can crack people, you can predict them with extreme accuracy. You are smart, you are very smart. You can do this

people are not confusing. you just failed at this game when you were young and you're too scared to try again. Try again. Make an anonymous account if you have to. Just say things, see how people respond
