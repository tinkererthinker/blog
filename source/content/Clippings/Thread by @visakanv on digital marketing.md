had an interesting chat with @andruspurde about the state of digital marketing – we both agreed that the more things change, and the more people get distracted by new-and-shiny things, the smarter it becomes to focus hard on making a great user experience https://outfunnel.com/8-marketing-recommendations-from-industry-insider/…

It seems to me that people struggle with this because they feel the pressure to improve the short term numbers – getting more leads & signups by pushing people harder. There's a delicate balance to be achieved – you DO want to make it as easy as possible, but \*not\* by shoving

A thing that I believe but can't exactly prove except anecdotally – the harder you push people through your funnel, the likelier it is that you're going to be flooded with low quality signups, while the people who would've been your best clients/users get turned off and leave

And if you create a really great UX, it's something that people talk about with other people. The most valuable real estate is in the honest conversational space between friends. And in the long run you can't exactly buy your way into this one (I wrote about this back in 2017)

What's the most valuable marketing real estate on Earth?

Might it be a 30-second primetime Superbowl commercial, which would've set you back $5,000,000 in 2016 (a staggering $166,666 per second)?

Or maybe it might be a glitzy $100,000-a-day, 24-million pixel LED billboard in the middle of New York's Times Square?

At ReferralCandy, we believe that the most valuable marketing real estate is to be found in the conversational space between friends.

We pay more attention to our friends than to any ad on TV.
