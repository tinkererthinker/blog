47\. Create-React-App and Gatsbyjs probably have made setup for Javascript projects much better.

Still probably not as easy to use or as powerful as shadow-cljs.

48\. Typescript is mostly hype.

49\. VScode is a typescript IDE, is probably pretty magical, and I am likely missing some cool sources of tools for thought inspiration by not playing in that ecosystem.

50\. Airtable is on track to be the Wordpress of relational databases.

51\. Graph databases are far better than relational databases for most things.

52\. Amendment to 4. No one who is loud about OO is doing real OO.

Agree Erlang is OO

53\. In general, folks thinking about programming languages and computing more broadly, don't know enough history.

Folks interested in the topic should read "The Dream Machine" to start and not blindly trust shitposters like me.

VN def over-hyped tho

54\. One reason to know history is so you can see what elements of your language were put in place to deal with constraints in your environment that no longer exist

We don't use punch-cards, we don't need a distinction between expressions and statements

55\. Questions are not a sign of ignorance, they are a sign you are paying attention.

It's more than OK to ask people to define terms or give a concrete example, and ok to stay in conversations you can barely understand.

Applies to conversations in and about all languages.

56\. Datomic is far and away the best graph database available today.

Has Java and Clojure APIs, non jvm languages can use rest apis.

If you're a startup, worth being in Clojure though.
