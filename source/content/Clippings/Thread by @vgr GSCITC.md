Gonzo mode plugs you into the scenius, but if you plug in completely, you can't outperform the scenius (& few communities are actually very good! Some end up strictly worse than the individuals in them!)

One alternative: plug into several communities (with no overlap aside from you) quite deeply, becoming the only information / entropy conduit between them. You become valued by each of them as a countermeasure to whatever groupthink loops, & have an outside view.

The value of (ex) old info from time-binding is not that it's old or that it was manufactured under circumstances of deep contemplation, but that it was manufactured under a different set of assumptions. It's simulated annealing for memeplexes: important in groups.

All groups amplify \*something\* based on biases in initial conditions. That \*something\* can be useful or harmful based on circumstances that the group can't recognize from inside itself. The ability to amplify it conflicts with the ability to recognize if it ought to be amplified.

So, percussive maintenance (like the periodic invasion of ideas so alien that they could not previously be conceived of by the group), while is lowers the highest highs, drastically increases expected yield. It slightly mediocritzes the future graveyards of great & terrible.

(Other forms of percussive maintenance of memeplexes, less effective than alien transmissions from Big Other: tarot & other forms of RNG-based bibliomancy; mind-{warping,expanding} drugs, especially psychedelics; psychological trauma; ecstatic spiritual experiences)

One's ability to add to the scenius is half integration with the scenius, but is half the ability to act as conduit for the alien. Integrate too deeply & you become a drone, incapable of challenging the models or doing higher-level integration of new information. An ideologue.
