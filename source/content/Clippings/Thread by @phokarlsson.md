"Don't think, look!" might be the most useful piece of writing advice you can squeeze into 3 words. So much bad writing comes from people moving words about on the page, instead of staring at the real thing and then adjusting their words to fit it.

learning to sketch has felt like better training for writing (and for science, for that matter) because I really can't fool myself about capturing the details accurately. writing has much worse feedback loops - you get many key details wrong but if it sounds nice people applaud

I do some "sketching" but for writing, that is, going around and looking at stuff and trying to write and edit until what I write matches what I see. if nothing else, it makes me humble about how horribly off my first attempts are, and how much of that I'd miss by not checking

I wonder how to get better feedback loops for writing. Like how do I actually know whether these words, when read by someone else (who exactly?), will create precisely the impression I meant to create or communicate precisely the experience I've had?

this part is hard. I don't think you can solve it in general, because of context collapse. but have a few readers give you detailed feedback so you notice what you miss or where they are confused etc, if you do that 50 times, I think it helps a bit
