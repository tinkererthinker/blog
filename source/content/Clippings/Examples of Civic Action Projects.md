#### Examples A

**Each CAP example features:**

- A problem or issue that matters to students;
- A public policy connection;
- Discrete civic actions designed to engage civil society and other community stakeholders with their problem or issue; and
- The use of media to inform and engage their audience about their concern and suggested actions to support a solution.

**Each project was completed over the course of a single semester following CAP teachers’ implementation of five core lessons. This lesson sequence is designed to engage students through:**

- Creating a profile of effective citizenship in a democracy;
- Defining public policy;
- Identifying the root causes and effects of a problem or issue;
- Analyzing real-life problems and issues being addressed through public policy; and
- Examining the role of the three branches of government in a specific case study.

With this foundation, CAP students created and documented the following civic experiences.
