could you make money by cloning an app that already exists, and marketing it to people who don't know it exists? how widespread is this? how could you find out the answer?

A common case is taking the same dating app, slap different brandings on it, and market it to different groups of people - seeing a lot of that in germany. Usually, the owner is the same though

it's crazy when it's the same owner!!

I mean, you already have the code and infra so firing up another instance is probably low cost, but let's you tap into a different section of the market

yes, AND it's delivering real value. Someone will clone it anyway to serve that untapped market. And that market wants something of a different vibe/branding. This is why marketing water to different people has so much money in it
