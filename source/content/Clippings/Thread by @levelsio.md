Europe's governments made energy expensive on purpose to stop you from using it!

Europe is anti-energy right now and taxes it heavily causing prices to be more than double than in the US:

\- US: $0.16 per kWh

\- EU avg: $0.31 per kWh (2x)

\- Germany: $0.44 per kWh (2.75x)

Energy

You got things wrong.

Germany had 3 power plants on 2022, at the same time it had 3 pipelines with Russia and 4th about to be open. Those pipelines provided far more energy than nuclear power plants AND were the raw input into chemical industry.

It's not as much about EU making

This is completely false

Germany had LOADS of nuclear power plants

Most of them were shutdown

Not in 2022. Maybe 2010, when they fully expected to be using Russian gas until 2100. But in 2022 only 3 were remaining.

It was insane to close them. One of the stupidest political move. Germans are not against nuclear anymore and gov lied to justify the closing.

Nuclear being cheap is the biggest myth. It never was, it certainly isn't with all the decommissioning cost and non-sensical ideas like SMRs (opposite of economies of scale) won't help. It's better than coal for resource independence and helpful to build a bomb, nothing more.

No @SimonTheNoob is right! The 3 remaining NPPs were shut down last year and power became CHEAPER!

They were „blocking“ the grid from renwables.

Now prices are at 0.257€/kwh (~0.28$) compared to >0.35€in Q1/23
