1\. Johnny Von Neumann isn't nearly as deep a genius as people seem to think.

If he was, he wouldn't have said bullshit like this

2\. Code is crystallized thought

3\. Object Oriented Programming (as practiced today) is bullshit.

Hedgehog paradigm.

Requires you to have taxonomic overview of the program you're writing before you start writing it.

Inevitable that will end up as spaghetti of incidental complexity.

4\. Nobody really has been doing OOP since SmallTalk (maybe RealTalk and the shit they've been doing at HARC and Dynamicland are exceptions)

Java and Ruby (God forbid Rails) and Objective C for sure aren't following Kay's footsteps.

5\. The purpose of a programming language (and the programs you write) is to build up useful abstractions that extend the realm of thinkable thought and hold otherwise intractable problems in your head.

6\. The measure of a good programming language is the speed at which you build DSLs for the problems you want to solve

The measure of good code is whether you and the people you work with are able to reuse it for problems you weren't anticipating when you wrote it initially.

7\. Syntax matters, a bit.

One simple reason Clojure is better than CommonLisp is that it is easier to read

Vectors are \[ \]

Let bindings in a vector

Maps are { }

keywords :this

In CL (vector a b c) (hashmap x 1 b 2) -- way harder to skim.

8\. Polish notation is way better for reading and writing code than things that try to look like english

9\. The ternary operator in Javascript is pretty dope though -- I do sometimes miss it when writing simple if statements in my let bindings.

Sometimes have thought about making a macro for it, but something tells me this is a sin I would live to regret.

10\. Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is true -- but the effects are far more pronounced for programming languages than for spoken languages.

The language you write code in ends up shaping huge parts of you worldview even when you're not programming

11\. Rich Hickey is a better guru than the Pope or the Dali Lama.

He understands exceptionally deep truths about the universe, and converts them into actionable tools for building a better world.

Learn about Whitehead's metaphysics through him

12\. The coolest thing about Javascript is prototypical inheritance.

Totally mind bending when you think about it, and how it maps to your mind.

Steve Yegge nailed it in this post

Better intro to Douglas Hofstadter's work than any I've seen by Doug.

13\. Any program could be theoretically written on in any turing complete language, but it is not actually possible for humans to write a complex web app in brainfuck

Same applies for modeling paradigms for problems and data

Some problems suit a given paradigm, some don't

14\. One of the best things about Clojure (as an "immigrant community") is that people bring paradigms and patterns with them from other languages.

APL, J -- very cool ideas there from array programming langs. Can play in that headspace via core.matrix

15\. Pattern matching in Erlang gives a totally different style for writing and thinking about recursive functions.

You get to step into that world thanks to Sean Johnson when you use core.match

16\. Clojure as a programming language community might be what really good post-racial Fascism looks like.

Everyone is there because they really love and trust Rich's aesthetics and principles. Glorious leader.

Great ideas brought in from everywhere, but filtered through a lens.
