I used to get sick from air conditioners bc of the drying air.

I realized NASA was the source who'd have the most trustable atmospheric data given the International Space Station is an endogenously controlled human optimized atmosphere with no room for error.

I implemented

There are many smart & affordable humidity sensors on Amazon's that can integrate with your setup.

The important thing is to test different levels until you find your optimum, but it will likely be between 40-60%

I had a friend that during summer I had to fight with to turn on the air conditioner because he always got sick. He implemented this and now isn't afraid to use the air conditioner and uses it all the time.

Bro, what's your set-up though? I have humidifiers already for plants in certain rooms and a hygrometer, but have no idea how I could automate that for a whole home. Just curious what all you use, as a starting point to research more thanks!
