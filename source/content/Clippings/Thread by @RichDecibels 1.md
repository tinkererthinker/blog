Twitter Is A Dating App For Making Friends

here's some ideas about how to have fun on twitter dot com

(this is the thread I will send to people on their first day here)

first: tweet a lot

there are no bad tweets. you are a hose, so gush!

let yourself flow & the algorithm will be your editor (posts that your followers find interesting are automatically promoted & the rest are demoted)

reply a lot

consider yourself invited into every conversation. if you want to make friends you have to visit other people's parties

large account = dinner party host

smol account = be the kind of guest that gets invited back

follow a lot of people

at first, follow anyone that seems vaguely interesting. later on, prune out the ones that don't spark joy

you can start with this list of people I find fun & friendly:

don't follow celebs/brands bc they are not seeking friends

TWITTER IS A DATING APP FOR MAKING FRIENDS

the usual flow looks like this:

1. reply to each other a bunch
2. follow each other ("mutuals")
3. private messages (DM = direct message or gc = group chat)
4. video call
5. local meetup
6. make babies/start a cult

**Richard D. Bartlett** @RichDecibels [2022-06-07](https://x.com/RichDecibels/status/1534169557690159105)

mute or block unfriendly people

mute = you won't see them anymore

block = they won't see you either

don't hesitate to use these great features! a tiny fraction of twitter users are mean. with one click you can be rid of them forever. don't think twice, just do it

**Richard D. Bartlett** @RichDecibels [2022-06-07](https://x.com/RichDecibels/status/1534170070859014144)

opt out of the culture war

polarised political arguments is twitters most popular and least fun game. don't play!

mute words that you don't want to see (eg I mute words like "gun control" "biden" "cops")

you can make money on twitter without being annoying:
1. have a buy now button 1 click away (link in yr bio or pinned tweet)
2. collect email addresses so you can take your audience with you one day (eg substack)
3. occasionally talk about the thing you sell when it is relevant

here's an excellent conversation about how you can use twitter to make friends, build a business, and follow your spiritual path all at the same time

What kinds of things do you reply?

try to guess what game the original poster is offering and then play the next move

eg interested questions, tangential riffs, respectful disagreement, simple encouragement, etc
