I've had an ear training eureka moment.

And yes, I was in the bath.

I've been slowly plugging away at learning intervals on @rickbeato's https://beatoeartraining.com and on the Functional Ear Trainer iPad app.

And I didn't think I was getting anywhere.

But I was lying in the bath earlier listening to some 1990s English pop music songs with my eyes closed and I found myself trying to pick out intervals.

At first it was all a wash of nice sounds and I thought I was going to get nowhere.

Then I narrowed down.

Was listening to just the bass (guitar) and started picking up or working out some notes.

Root. Root. That'll be the fifth. Yes, fifth. Root.

Then I became aware that there was a load of space between the bass and the guitars and the vocal line.

Then I found myself picking up some (clean) guitar chords.

1\. 1. 4.

Then I had a bit of "ARRRGGGHHH! I'm hearing numbers! I've ruined music for myself and all I'll hear from now on is numbers!"

Took a while to get over that and reassure myself.

Found myself doing it again. Picking up some distorted guitar chords and single note at a time riff lines.

The vocal stuff I can't hear right at all yet though. That's going to take some work. I'm thinking I will have to latch the vocals to either chords or the bass line.

I'm still kinda freaked out.

It's like a door opened in my head and I have now been into a new magical world.

And there's loads of work to be done in there to build up accuracy and endurance and isolating bits to work through.

This is good.
