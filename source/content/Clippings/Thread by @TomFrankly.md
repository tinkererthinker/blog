I've always hated running.

But I started running anyway at the beginning of January. I wanted to see if I could finally build up good cardio.

7mph pace at first. It was hard. My heart rate was Zone 4 for most of it.

For most of January, I'd do cardio before lifting 3-4 times a week. I'd do 15-20 mins on the treadmill, then throw in 15 mins of stairs.

On off days, I started walking anywhere from 7-14 miles. I used that time to listen to audiobooks.

Each workout day, I tried to up the running difficulty in some way. I'd bump the treadmill speed a bit, or increase the incline, or just try to run longer.

Near the end of January I was sustaining an 8.5mph average pace ‚Äì but my heart rate was in Zone 5 for most of it. It was torture.

I'd imagine Arnold or Gordon Ramsay were yelling at me the whole time to keep myself from quitting. I'm not sure why those two are my spirit drill instructors, but they are.

Then I read some posts on the running subreddit saying I'd plateau doing this, and I first needed to spend a long time building up a "zone 2" cardio base.

For me, that means running slow enough to keep my heart rate around 135-145 bpm.

So I started doing that for a while.

Then something funny happened... I realized that I was actually enjoying my runs.

I kept finding excuses not to quit at my planned time.

"Let me just finish this song, then I'll stop."

I can't stress this enough: I've always hated running. But now, somehow, I enjoy it. Outside, yes, but even in the gym on a treadmill.

I enjoy other cardio as well. Yesterday I managed a full hour ‚Äì¬†I rotated between running, rowing (first time ever), stairs, and bike.

I actually look forward to it.

I guess I just needed to train consistently enough to get to where a light jog doesn't take me out of zone 2.

Try Spartan Race or Hyrox, adds running but a functional exercise component.

Been a game changer for me going from all powerlifting to incorporating running.

I did a few of those when I was younger and enjoyed them! Specifically I enjoyed the obstacles, not the running üòÇ

But maybe with my better conditioning I'd now enjoy the whole thing.

Nice! This sounds a bit like the approach of @AliAbdaal where you focus on making it fun, instead of hard/productive. Right?

**Thomas Frank** @TomFrankly [2024-02-05](https://x.com/TomFrankly/status/1754513101167178162)

In this case it feels like I had to focus on getting through the hard part so it could become fun

Thanks for sharing, TF. You think it was a zone thing? I took a different conclusion. Seems it was getting permission to run at an enjoyable, non-frantic pace. Like going from speed walking to a leisurely stroll. Sounds like your perspective on what it means to jog changed.

**Thomas Frank** @TomFrankly [2024-02-06](https://x.com/TomFrankly/status/1754896522515226966)

Partly that, but partly building up the cardio so that slower pace is able to be enjoyable in the first place.

**Thomas Frank** @TomFrankly [2024-02-05](https://x.com/TomFrankly/status/1754512571456016819)

Haha yep, that's pretty much what mine looked like the week before I lowered my pace!

My trainer told me not to jog, it‚Äôs bad for the knees. I‚Äôm in a sprinting program now, and dude. üòÆ‚Äçüí®

**Thomas Frank** @TomFrankly [2024-02-05](https://x.com/TomFrankly/status/1754359858306941118)

I haven't been sprinting, but I've been doing heavy sled pushes and pulls, and tire flips. I feel you!

I'm more likely to engage in an activity if I don't torture myself

Got it üëç

**Thomas Frank** @TomFrankly [2024-02-05](https://x.com/TomFrankly/status/1754619073193754882)

Yes, but I also think going through the discomfort of running for nearly a month got me to the other side where it's enjoyable.

I was walking long distances for months before that, and that alone didn't get me over that hump.

I really enjoy running but 1 mile in my feet go numb. I‚Äôve tried different shoes, sizes and stretches. Doctor thinks it may be nerve related, but meds haven‚Äôt helped much. Still a mystery :(

**Thomas Frank** @TomFrankly [2024-02-05](https://x.com/TomFrankly/status/1754352233481719970)

Ah that sucks! Are you able to do other things like biking or rowing?

Dude, same, started running 4 weeks ago. Used to run barefoot 5-7mi a day in my mid 20s and haven't ever since. Took a bit to get back into it but now really starting to love it again.

**Thomas Frank** @TomFrankly [2024-02-05](https://x.com/TomFrankly/status/1754341230538789066)

Nice! Still barefoot?

I gave barefoot shoes a really solid try last August. I do like them, but I think walking so much on concrete isn't compatible with them (and my own knee/ankle issues).

Got a pair of Altras and it feels like I've gained a superpower.

Welcome to zone 2! You can also get a VO2max and resting metabolic rate test to get that really dialed in. Could go full lactate tests if you want as well

**Thomas Frank** @TomFrankly [2024-02-05](https://x.com/TomFrankly/status/1754349812852338991)

Would that essentially tell me what range to actually look for on my Apple watch while running? (I'm not sure I want to go as far as wearing a HR monitor)

I enjoy running, but don't really like to do it that often. But I really love the rowing machine for my regular cardio.

I try to get in one longer Zone 2 row each week and then one day on the rower where I get in some max effort work.

**Thomas Frank** @TomFrankly [2024-02-05](https://x.com/TomFrankly/status/1754340566895059217)

I'm hoping I'll come to enjoy the rowing as well! I did mostly enjoy my first session, but my butt was pretty sore after only 15 minutes. Might just be due to me not being used to it.
