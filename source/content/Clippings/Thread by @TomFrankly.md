Glad to see Jimmy directly acknowledging survivor bias here.

Create content as a side project, and only drop things to go full-time once it makes financial sense to do so. Key word "financial" – getting a ton of views isn't enough.

The way I did it personally:

Early on, I just used any and all free time I had to make content. I balanced it with a full college class load and part-time job, doing a lot of it on nights and weekends.

Ask my friends; they'd be in the dorm playing Call of Duty, I'd be behind them on my computer writing blog posts.

When my blog started to get traction, I slowly started to reduce my workflow – first by dropping some extracurriculars I felt were no longer a good time investment.

Once it hit full-time income, I still decided to finish my degree and graduate.

Do you recommend a certain runway before making the leap?

What’s the checklist that needs to be met in your eyes?

In my case, my expenses were about $1,000/mo at the time since I was living with 3 other roommates in Iowa.

I left my part-time job midway through my senior year, only after I was making $3k+ per month from my blog.

I don't know that I have a general recommendation since everyone has different circumstances. I suppose I'd feel comfortable telling my former 21-year-old self that 6 months of runway would be acceptable if my project had started making money and income was growing, but not full-time yet.
