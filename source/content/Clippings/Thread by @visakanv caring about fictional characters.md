A thing I noticed fairly early-ish on is that people care about things more once they‚Äôre framed properly. Like, if you watch a documentary about a pit crew or a kitchen or a tattoo shop, you become invested in those people‚Äôs struggles and you start to care about them personally

And so like... witnessing this, I think I always thought... I want that! I want people to care about me. What I‚Äôve been grappling with recently is whether that was some innate thing all along, or a response to perceived injustice. I \*was\* a pretty reclusive bookworm. Still am tbh

If you think about it, this broader phenomenon also explains why people so often have stronger feelings about fictional characters (the ones that make it are well-framed) than real people (seldom well-framed)

Once I witnessed this I could never unsee it. You can manipulate words to make things more valuable, seemingly creating value out of thin air. It‚Äôs ‚Äújust‚Äù about better framing

Dumpster-diving for meaning

I think most people understand this when thinking about presidential candidates and campaigns. Elections can be won or lost because of frames.

And...

It‚Äôs something that affects personal livelihoods too. It can be a matter of life and death

if you‚Äôre not born into a supportive environment, all you can do is find one! (or make one, but that is not the advice i would give the average person)

tragically a lot of the shared environments of co-sufferers are often themselves full of cruelty‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve come to think of the bigger picture as a sort of ladder, and each rung has a homeostatic effect that will keep you on it, and it‚Äôs a whole new jailbreak to leap to the next

this is true. i tend to think of this as something like ‚Äúoutgrowing your pot.‚Äù you grow as much as you can where you are, and when the walls start to feel close, you need repotting. hopefully you notice before becoming rootbound(turning back in on yourself, taking on pot shape)

One of the reasons I‚Äòve always been drawn to study fiction, marketing and philosophy is the following, non-judgemental observation:

People care more about fictional characters than real people.

It‚Äôs because fictional stories are told more skillfully, and framed better

I think there are things I‚Äôve come to learn about charm and likability that are practically too dangerous to discuss openly

It only takes two retweets to end up in completely hostile territory

there‚Äôs a reason I tell all my friends to write their memoirs. once you‚Äôve articulated your own story you can hit ‚Äúinspect element‚Äù on it, edit it, modify it. It is a source of tremendous power. You can use stories to get yourself to care about you, too
