0/ For those who are curious, here are my top picks. Note that these are for a first-year college course lab session (so I want enough quality material to finish in about 1.5 hours, and minimize software install). See below: ↵

1/ Our SQL winner is this "murder mystery". We had three runners-up:

https://selectstarsql.com

https://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey…

https://datacarpentry.org/sql-ecology-lesson…

The winner and top runner-up need no database install! ↵

2/ For the shell, we went with Software Carpentry (up through but not including the bash material, starting with "loops").

The runner-up was this:

https://pwn.college/linux-luminarium/…

(Main downside is it's too long for our lab time.) ↵

3/ For git—oh, git—top pick was again Software Carpentry:

https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/

For those finishing early, we suggested this for fun:

https://ohmygit.org

And for branching (for later reference), this one:

4/ Thanks to the MANY people who replied. I must say that some of the most frequently cited were just not very impressive IMO, but I don't want to put down anyone, so I'll just not…mention them. Lots of other good ones for other durations/settings. See replies to original tweet.

Not a tutorial, but an invaluable reference for how to recover when you've messed up:

It's funny how many of these there are, like

https://ohshitgit.com

It's telling when a system needs these…
