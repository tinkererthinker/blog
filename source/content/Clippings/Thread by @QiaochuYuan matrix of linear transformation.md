there should be standard notation for "the matrix of a linear transformation T : V -> W with respect to a basis B of V and a basis C of W" and it should be \_C\[T\]\_B

pdf i wrote about this when TA'ing a linear algebra class: https://math.berkeley.edu/~qchu/54/Matrices.pdf…

also coordinate-free linear algebra should be taught with string diagram notation, like this:

fun fact: @EdwardTufte came across these blog posts once and liked them so much he sent me free copies of his books on data visualization, none of which i have read (sorry!)
