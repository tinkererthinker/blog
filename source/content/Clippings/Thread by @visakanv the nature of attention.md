those who are great at learning + teaching people how to learn, know that learning at it's core is about love, about giving a shit, about about curiosity and delight and desire

now consider all the ways in which school is the literal opposite of that

there is a contaminant in the collective consciousness making everybody sick and we mostly sorta assume that it's just the way of the world, like how it was the way of the world 50 years ago that everybody smoked cigarettes everywhere and you had to just accept it

there's many different parts to this complex puzzle but for now i guess i'll just end by reaffirming that this is what i want to spend the rest of my life working on. in the immediate future this means writing a bunch of essays

and part of the reason i've been taking so long and struggling so hard is, as RM pointed out, we don't even have the language for it. we are grasping in the dark. but i believe meaningful progress can be made and i intend to contribute however i can

we KNOW that great learning happens with love + curiosity

we KNOW that the majority of our environments in civilization aren't particularly awash in those things

we can REASONABLY ASSUME that creating such environments will promote great learning
