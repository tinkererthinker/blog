**ivan** @IvanVendrov [2025-02-03](https://x.com/IvanVendrov/status/1886247296968393156)

it is simultaneously true that

1\. you are probably trying too hard. just set a strong intention and let your subconscious do the rest

2\. everything you want is bottlenecked by a skill issue. the human superpower is (culturally augmented) rapid skill acquisition

the synthesis?

like most dichotomies it's probably trivial to resolve for some people, but I notice I'm not sure I know how to hold the 'acquire skills' and 'surrender' intentions simultaneously. skill acquisition feels inherently try-inflected

@dkazand would say the synthesis is flow, and maybe I'm just asking 'how to get in flow more'. where do I learn this meta-skill? seems like @RomeoStevens76 would have ideas

**ivan** @IvanVendrov [2025-02-03](https://x.com/IvanVendrov/status/1886248404960874727)

but 'flow' is a bit too facile. the highest level of skill require great effort and sacrifice, or so their practitioners tells us. where is the synthesis of david goggins and alexander technique?

best answer so far! 'don't try hard to gain skills, put yourself where the skilled people are and relax'

cc @dkazand "if you lived with Jocko and David Goggins you would get up at 5 am and work out with no effort"

I don’t know anyone who is trying too hard. But a lot of people are mistaken about what they are trying to do.

when I say try hard I admittedly mean "try hard in the unskillful and self-defeating way pointed to by notions like tanha and wu-wei". I agree virtually nobody is trying hard in the eyes of God

1\. doesn’t seem true at all, most are ‘not even trying’

synthesis:

you are "trying too hard" at stuff that doesn't work, and not trying potentially more effective alternatives \*at all\*.

**ivan** @IvanVendrov [2025-02-03](https://x.com/IvanVendrov/status/1886449524425769100)

mm I like this. reminds me of Moshe Feldenkrais (loosely paraphrased) 'the solution to failure is never effort; if you find yourself applying effort, pay closer attention instead, until you learn the skill of doing it effortlessly'

Develop the skill of finding/noticing/implementing ways to reach your goals without relying on trying unrealistically hard.

No such thing as a skill issue. You either have it in you or you don’t. No skill is acquired. It’s a fake notion. It’s all about nature.

**ivan** @IvanVendrov [2025-02-03](https://x.com/IvanVendrov/status/1886448323579777446)

this seems ludicrous on its surface but I'm sure you're pointing to something true, would appreciate elaboration

neville goddard was right in some aspects. don’t focus on how just let the why exist

**ivan** @IvanVendrov [2025-02-03](https://x.com/IvanVendrov/status/1886446952457335080)

interesting never heard of him before. where should I start?

**bustlingbungus** @bustlingbungus [2025-02-03](https://x.com/bustlingbungus/status/1886438459889287202)

put self near skilled people and absorb skills culturally?

The solution is to stop wanting

---

**ivan** @IvanVendrov [2025-02-03](https://x.com/IvanVendrov/status/1886448481541235027)

that is a 'solution' in the same sense as suicide is a solution. no thanks

The answer is to invest your attention consciously and with great care. Compounding interest over weeks over years over decades.

Matthew Crawford partially addresses this in \_The World Beyond Your Head\_.

would love a quote from the book if you have it - drowning in book recs rn

idk about point 2. finitude does exist.

in the hypothetical world where infinite skill points exist, then #2 is true

but, then we might have different problems because \*everyone\* would have infinite skill points to spend on whatever - so, I expect lots of chaos and thrash ?

Often when different views on something seem hard to reconcile, it’s because we are using a single word for a fuzzy idea that might better be thought of as multiple things.

“Skill” might be a word like that here. For example, skill can mean insight or ability to certain goals.

Realise you are deciding even when it doesn't feel like you are deciding. Eg. When not practicing a skill. The synthesis is the life you actually live. What a wrestling match.

---

**Karl Nieberding** @wizardofux [2025-02-03](https://x.com/wizardofux/status/1886419216921727480)

The synthesis is to try intentionally to build the skills you need, not just "work hard" in general and burnout.

a lot of magick is about getting your unconscious to guide you in a specific direction

sometimes the conscious and unconscious overlap and you are aware of the skill acquisition, but it's a process that should still happen even when you are not paying attention
