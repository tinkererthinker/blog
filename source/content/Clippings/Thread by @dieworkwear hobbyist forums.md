imagine being sad, so you treat yourself to a pair of nice pants. but you're also anxious, so you research who makes the best pants. and you're argumentative, so you spend the next 15 years reading, writing, and interviewing people to prove someone was wrong on a menswear forum

> @dieworkwear Hi! Understandable if you don’t see this/reply to it, but just curious, how do you know so much about fashion? I see you’re a menswear writer so is it through work research, education focus, or is it just a personal passion and you have an incredible memory?

this discourse just shows how bad social media is at learning anything. the internet was better when it was centered around hobbyist forums where hyper focused nerds cross examined and bullied you. go post this nonsense on purseforum and see what happens.

i honestly think the switch from forums to social media platforms has been bad for online discourse bc there's no way you could do this schtick for 10 years on a forum without getting mercilessly clowned. this sort of thing only exists on social media

you used to be able to ID which forum people were from based on their perspective. each forum was like its own school of thought—each had unique strengths and weaknesses. when someone from one forum went to another forum, there would be fights like that bruce lee scene.

we're you part of hobbyist forums from 2005 to 2015? did you see those forums decline? if so, i would like to hear the story of how those forums changed—what caused the decline, where did users migrate, and are those hobbyist convos still happening or did they disappear?

In the mid- to late-2000s, I found that a lot of menswear discourse happened on forums, where you had people who were just coming online and finding camaraderie with fellow nerds. These people, who were just finding online communities, drew their knowledge from diverse source materials, such as books and years of conversations with tailors. Now, a lot of menswear discourse is shaped by the same online source materials, such as pods, blogs, Twitter, Instagram, and the general Online Discourse. This makes opinions within the community very predictable, and the discourse a bit boring. If you are Very Online, you've seen it all. The breakdown of forums, and their replacement by a wide variety of other places to spend online, means that each walled garden only has a couple of hardcore nerds. So while the mid-2000s may have had 20 Super Nerds on one forum, now there are only a couple of nerds in each small community, making the discourse in those places less vibrant. For people with other hobbies and who have spent a lot of time online, I'm curious if you've seen a similar trajectory in online discourse within your hobby.

forget social networks. bring back forums and RSS feeds and little microblogs focused on extremely niche things like interior design, fashion, and 1942 tibetan punk rock music, where people write little interesting posts and the comment section is generally upbeat and happy

i shopped for a suit in the early 2000s and fell into a wormhole of menswear blogs and forums, which resulted in me arguing about clothes online for more than 20 years. i am now on twitter.

I think the trick is to immerse yourself in nerd culture, join a forum specializing in that hobby, reorient your entire personality around this hobby, and then spend 10 years arguing with people online you'll never meet before making your purchase

i agree. the special thing about forums was the concentration of hyper-focused weirdos. it led to very interesting, educational, and at times entertaining discussions. twitter is much more of a general space, often infected with political vitriol. agree forums were better

yea, i knew a lot of people who were deterred from participating on forums because of the culture there. if you were willing to put up with the hostility, you'd learn a lot though, and prob form some good friendships.

i would pay $8/month to be transported back to 2010, when tumblr blogs were a thing, google still had an RSS reader, and very knowledgeable people participated on specialized hobbyist forums, where there was a general sense of camaraderie, even if at times they roasted noobs

By age 35, you should have 1 cat, a "least favorite" fork, and at least 25,000 posts logged into a niche hobbyist forum, where you've developed highly specialized knowledge, as well as allies and enemies. If you don't, you're pretty much guaranteed to be a failure in life.

it depresses me that there's not a single good online forum/ arena to discuss fashion nowadays. not one. forums are dead. twitter is a cesspool. blogs are basically gone. fucking dire.

yes, i think about that, too. a lot of info is now on discord, podcasts, substacks, tiktoks, and other unsearchable mediums, which i think will make it harder for some people to discover pools of knowledge in the future.

me having a cat is not the reason why i don't have children. i don't have children bc i got into niche hobbyist forums in the mid-2000s and have spent the last 20 years arguing online about pants.

in the last 7 years, the online convo around menswear has radically shifted from blogs to Instagram. I feel the vacuum left behind by blogs has made a real impact. 15 years ago, menswear blogs pushed the message "buy less, buy better." they taught ppl how to spot quality
