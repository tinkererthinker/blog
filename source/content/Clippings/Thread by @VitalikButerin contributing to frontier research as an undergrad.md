A mini-tutorial on how complicated technical things are done and what some of the technical challenges are in a totally different industry:

As a side note, I am \*deeply\* disappointed by the uncaring attitude toward intellectual accessibility in the hackernews thread on this article:

Nonstop shudder.

Given my own experience reading wiki articles (and academic articles) on mathematical topics, I know that the people saying "well you can't dumb it down \*too\* much" are NOT being reasonable. We are VERY VERY FAR from any state remotely resembling "dumbed down too much".

It would be great to have domain knowledge levels to tab between. Something like high school / undergrad / postgrad.

The fundamental problem with even thinking about it in terms of "high school / undergrad / postgrad" is that it assumes that everyone takes the same path to learning a field. This may have been true 20 years ago. This is increasingly not true today.

It's very easy to have full up-to-the-frontier knowledge of one part of a field, even to the point that you're making original contributions, while still being "first-year-undergrad" level in a directly adjacent area.

It was just an example as there are certain standards of what we expect people at those levels to be able to comprehend. Layman / experienced / technical would be the same thing imo.

Agree there's nothing wrong with considering different levels; I'm just suggesting to make sure to remember that your readers will have very uneven levels of understanding of any background material a topic requires

Forgive the lack of granularity, twitter doesnâ€™t give a lot of room to expand on ideas. Conceptually we are in agreement 100%
