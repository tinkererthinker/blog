a really cool thing you can do with an ADHD brain is to "zoom in". Your brain is still jumping all over the place, but instead of switching tasks, it switches sub-tasks within the main tasks, and your productivity skyrockets

@alexpotato @0xKruger it's like this

- Important point here that the initial goal needs to be so close it’s nearly impossible to miss it. Then you reach it and feel good and off to the races riding that motivation.

I'd love to read more about this, if it's not too much trouble, do you know of any good resources to explain this a bit more?

not yet unfortunately ! it's just something that I have observed is true for me (but usually i'll tweet about it, if others feel it they'll describe it, and as I get more of a handle on it i'll keep describing it!)

Totally. I call this fractal thinking.

For any thought, you can always take one aspect, and expand your thoughts on it. This is the nature of thought and language.

By trusting my mind (and with practice), I let go of keeping track of where in the stack I am, thus more brain space for what is in the moment. Gentle cues to refocus as needed for purpose.

this is why programming works so well for me. I can pretty easily get deep enough into programming brain context that most task switches/distractions are relevant and useful and bring me more into the zone. and I can just trust the process and explore subtrees
