I tried but I really suck at hearing harmony... anyone willing to record a guide for me? I'll pay ofc. If you have to ask what a harmony guide is, you're prob not right for the job so don't flood my replies. :P DM if we're mutuals.

I really recommend this... this is more of a long-term solution that you'll be able to keep in your brain for the rest of your life.

My thing is that I have fine relative pitch, but I cannot always pick out a background harmony when there are multiple parts at the same time.

It's more about learning the harmonic intervals when played at the same time, being able to hear the chords, and knowing how those chords are made up... esp chords with 7ths, 9ths, and 13ths.

Like if you know the chord that's being played in the song, the vocal harmony can only be one of a few notes. So don't focus on the vocal harmony, focus on the entire chord and you'll be able to find the vocal harmony really fast.

The harmonies in a lot of these songs are also not just simple 3rds or 5ths. It makes it a lot more difficult.
