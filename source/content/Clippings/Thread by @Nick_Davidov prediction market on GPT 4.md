GPT4 will be out soon and will probably cause a similar economic shock to one from Covid. Instant distribution with nearly instant adoption and nearly instant productivity increase for hundreds of millions of knowledge workers. Brace yourselves, 2023 is coming

Want to bet on this? $100,000, even odds, mutually agreeable judge.

What do you mean by even odds? :) I’m already betting on it with my VC investments in this field. Not interested in 2x

I mean that what @ESYudkowsky uses here is a manipulation. Obviously any forecasted black swan event has orders of magnitude lower probability of happening than “not happening”. Then there’s leeway for an argument on a magnitude of such event.

This is why he feels it’s a safe bet to put $100k on a 2x opportunity of something not happening. I find it’s a better strategy to make many $100k bets on variations of this happening with possible 100x outcomes within a diversified portfolio of VC bets.

Unlike twitter bets, my bets are real and we’ve made 36 of them just this year.
