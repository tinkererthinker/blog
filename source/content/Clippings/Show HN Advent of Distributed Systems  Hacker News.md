Hey! I built a playground called Advent of Distributed Systems ([https://aods.cryingpotato.com/](https://aods.cryingpotato.com/)) where you can work through the Fly.io distributed systems challenges ([https://fly.io/dist-sys/1/](https://fly.io/dist-sys/1/)) directly in your browser. Running challenges like this directly in the browser has often been the best way for me to get the activation energy to start them since it bypasses all the annoying dev environment setup that has to happen as a precursor to working on it.
