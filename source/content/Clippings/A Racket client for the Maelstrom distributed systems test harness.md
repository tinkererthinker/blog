[Maelstrom](https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom) is a workbench for learning distributed systems by writing your own. This is a library to allow implementing a Maelstrom server node in Racket, similar to [existing implementations in other languages](https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/tree/main/demo).

Familiarity with Maelstrom terminology is assumed. The following resources are handy:

- [Maelstrom: Getting Started](https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/doc/01-getting-ready/index.md)
- [Maelstrom: A simple echo server](https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/doc/02-echo/index.md)
