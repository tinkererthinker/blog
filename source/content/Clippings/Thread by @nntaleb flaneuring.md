Flaneuring cities in non-fancy, non-touristic streets, getting the neighborhood spirit Œ£' Œ±œÖœÑŒÆ œÑŒ∑ Œ≥ŒµŒπœÑŒøŒΩŒπŒ¨:

Naples (#1 by far)

Beirut

Athens

Istanbul

Palermo

Belgrade

Bucharest

Non Med, non-post-Ottoman cities ("North Atlantic") are too self-conscious abt hanging laundry...

2) Perhaps my best flaneuring was with @sez\_dss in Tripoli when #ISIS was still present in some neighborhoods where stores sold #ISIS flags.

3) ODORS

In Patrick S√ºskind's Perfume, the wet nurse returns an orphan, repulsed at his lack of smell.

You get the same w/cities of the North, or those with large avenues, as if there was a truncation into lower dimensions.

Did Jane Jacobs discuss the odor of neighborhoods?

4) Flaneuring is an all day thingy, not just a 4PM aerobic walk for an hour while listening to a science podcast. The route MUST be unpredicted.

I once dragged the unsuspecting @stevenstrogatz on an 9 hour flaneuring episode in Manhattan. He has refused to talk to me since.

5) The only nonrandom aspect of the walk with @stevenstrogatz was the Brownian Bridge of squid ink restaurants in Manhattan.

Would think Nicosia makes this list

---

**Nassim Nicholas Taleb** @nntaleb [2021-07-31](https://x.com/nntaleb/status/1421447272966021120)

Too small, no? I flaneured with @spyrosmakrid in Athens in 2008 but never got the "feel" in Nicosia, otherwise extremely pleasant.

**Atrin Assa** @AtrinAssa [2021-07-31](https://x.com/AtrinAssa/status/1421456022103859204)

Have you done the big cities further east?

---

**Nassim Nicholas Taleb** @nntaleb [2021-07-31](https://x.com/nntaleb/status/1421456318657966085)

Shanghai, Beijing, Tokyo, H-K, Singapore... of these Tokyo is paradoxically the best for flaneuring. Others are too dominated by buildings.

**C√©sar Campos** @cesarcampos67 [2021-07-31](https://x.com/cesarcampos67/status/1421444826285871104)

Lisbon. Laundry hangs profusely.

---

**Nassim Nicholas Taleb** @nntaleb [2021-07-31](https://x.com/nntaleb/status/1421445590391664642)

Became too touristy.

**Terrance** @exitmultiple [2021-08-01](https://x.com/exitmultiple/status/1421901629759102983)

Can attest, Istanbul is a top 10.

**Proc Marco** @procmarco [2021-07-31](https://x.com/procmarco/status/1421542997641072644)

Given that you like Palermo and Naples, you may enjoy Catania if you haven't visited

**Ivailo Gaidarski** @IRevoltBulgaria [2021-07-31](https://x.com/IRevoltBulgaria/status/1421507139168768012)

Bucharest in the list surprised me. An awful city.

When will you try Tehran?

**Julia Rived** @PreferNobody [2021-07-31](https://x.com/PreferNobody/status/1421453164151181315)

As a Neapolitan-born, I concur. Catanzaro is up there too, though probably too small to make the register.

**Velina Tchakarova** @vtchakarova [2021-07-31](https://x.com/vtchakarova/status/1421447267941224463)

**Ravi Mruthyunjaya** @ravi\_m [2021-07-31](https://x.com/ravi_m/status/1421484073294442506)

Gracia in Barcelona? Narrow streets, outdoor cafes, laundry drying everywhere, people hanging out on balconies and squares ...

**Thomas Long** @thomas\_long [2021-07-31](https://x.com/thomas_long/status/1421514488558211073)

What about French Med towns / villages?

Toulon, Fr√©jus, Bormes Les Mimosas, etc.

**CocoaB√§rchi** @cocoabaerchi [2021-07-31](https://x.com/cocoabaerchi/status/1421447869110923269)

I would add La Valetta as well

**mahesh kulkarni** @mak007kulkarni [2021-07-31](https://x.com/mak007kulkarni/status/1421457986350768135)

**Vix Khalifa** @zoagfresh [2021-07-31](https://x.com/zoagfresh/status/1421455153236938753)

Thessaloniki should make it‚Äôs way to that list.

Unfortunately these cities too are losing their charm and becoming alike, so sad

**Diocletian** @orodreath\_xx [2021-07-31](https://x.com/orodreath_xx/status/1421533553859440647)

Barceloneta balconies in Barcelona, they tend to be full of hanging clothes as well

**andy\_yc\_chan** @andyycchan1 [2021-07-31](https://x.com/andyycchan1/status/1421461380515966982)

Tbilisi definitely has some charm and some taste-tastic soup and local eateries. Maybe a little bet internet?

---

**Mark Wylie** @MarkKWylie [2021-07-31](https://x.com/MarkKWylie/status/1421455197830668290)

Agree with your list for sure. I'd add Taipei and Hanoi as a vote from Asia (and I've lived here in Asia for quite a while). And tbh, any Bavarian town is good for me as it will at least end in a great beer

**Dorjan Hysi** @thedoridori [2021-08-01](https://x.com/thedoridori/status/1421761099540701184)

Maybe some other near Mediterranean gems could make it into the list, say Arles and Avignon in France, Amman in Jordan (though I did miss alcohol there) and I am gonna go ahead with Tirana in Albania as well since we are looking for the neighborhood non touristic spirit üòâ

I've learned something today... Am I a "fl√¢neuse"? I like my city's arborized streets with old houses.

Flaneuring is for literary types in need of exercise,they should do it in flannel just for fun.

Visit small town of Parga in Greece near Albania. Its one of the most beautiful places on the planet. So as Kamakura

Time for you to flaneur in Latin America. There's so much Med migration during the XX century that all these images would look very much in place there

5 from this list checked and I agree so much. People find it strange I'm not thrilled to visit Paris or London.

You would love Chios City on Chios Island Greece - August 1-20 for Flaneuring - June July for a med escape. The land of Mastiha with perfect scents and weather in August. Nothing like it. Next summer - I‚Äôd love to show you around. Its most Eastern Med of Greece. The Anti-Mykonos
