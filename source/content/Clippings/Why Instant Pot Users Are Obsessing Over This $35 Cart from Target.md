If you just got a new Instant Pot, besides asking yourself “What should I cook?” ([we got you](https://www.thekitchn.com/50-recipes-that-you-can-make-in-your-instant-pot-233637)), you may also be wondering “Where the heck do I put this thing?” A true kitchen workhorse, it nevertheless can occupy some serious real estate on the counter or in a cabinet. Or, perhaps even worse, finding a home for your a new pressure cooker in a low cabinet or closet can mean it gets forgotten.

Luckily, the passionate members of the [official Instant Pot Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/InstantPotCommunity/) have discovered a product that almost seems made specifically for this product. The ultimate storage solution: a round utility cart from Target.

The $35 cart is part of Target’s Made By Design collection, [which launched back in June](https://www.thekitchn.com/target-made-by-design-home-line-photos-2018-259432). We’re not sure when the cart itself launched, but it began making waves in the Facebook group back in September. And it’s only gotten more and more love since then.

What makes this cart so great? The Instant Pot fits perfectly on the top shelf, leaving the smaller shelves for [various accessories](https://www.thekitchn.com/best-instant-pot-accessories-256832). And because the cart has wheels, it can be tucked away and brought out when needed, even in smaller kitchens. (One small apartment owner keeps hers in a space under her stairs.) But even though it’s great for small spaces, it will still accommodate the largest size Instant Pot, like this photo from newly minted cart and IP owner Stephanie Deal shows.

And another happy Instant Pot owner, with all her accessories neatly stored below.

Some users are going a step further — storing *two* Instant Pots on the cart. While the shelves aren’t tall enough for even a mini, there are a few ways to make it work. One Instant Pot user just chose to store the second IP on the cart without the lid.

But if you’re willing to forgo the middle shelf (or even flip it upside down), you can store two Instant Pots on it no problem. One cart owner went a little further. Snow Maysles’ husband respositioned the middle shelf by drilling new holes into the frame!

The Instant Pot community’s love for this cart has also begun to spread beyond the Facebook group. When we last counted, the were [235 reviews of the cart](https://www.target.com/p/round-metal-utility-cart-made-by-design-153/-/A-53308484?preselect=53166287&showOnlyReview=true) on Target’s website. And 75 explicitly mention using it for Instant Pot storage. Of those 75 reviews, 45 use the word “perfect” or “perfectly” to describe it. As one happy customer put it, “No wonder this has become The Instant Pot Cart.”

One word of caution: Several people have posted about cooking with the Instant Pot while still on the cart. While no one has reported any problems with this, we feel the best place for your Instant Pot to be used is on your counter because it’s flat, high up (and harder to reach for small kids), and shows a clear path from the Instant Pot to the outlet (and no wheels that could accidentally pull it away).
