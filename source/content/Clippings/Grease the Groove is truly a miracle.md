If you're unfamiliar, Grease the Groove is a training technique that Pavel Tsatsouline is largely credited for. The way he explains it, if you want to build strength or add reps to an exercise you need to do that exercise often but stay far away from failure or fatigue so for example if you can do an exercise for a max of 10 reps Pavel recommends only doing 5 reps *or less* and have at least 15 minutes of rest between sets but the rest between sets can really be as long as you want it to be. You can even take a nap then an hour after the nap do the next set or do one set before you leave the house in morning and do the next one when you get home from work. He also doesn't seem too bothered about how many sets you should do.

Man, I used to think this was too good to be true.

He made it sound like, "Yeah all you need to do is bang out a few easy reps here and there and you're gonna get stronger."

And I was like, "There must be more to this." So I thought maybe it was the volume you accumulate throughout your day that caused improvements so what I did was make sure I always did at least 10 sets and also made sure that for example if I set my reps to 5, I'd always hit 5 reps in every set no matter what. Also, because its hard to remember to do 10 sets throughout your day I set an interval timer for 30 minutes each as soon as I got home so that every 30 minutes I'd be reminded to do another set. I thought if 15 minutes was the minimum time to rest then surely I'll get better results with twice that much rest.

But what happened? I started getting aches and pains in my muscles and joints. These didn't feel like soreness, they felt like I had needles stuck inside my muscles and I actually got weaker and weaker because the more I went on, the more I had to struggle to hit every rep in every set that I did.

I initially tried Grease the Groove to add numbers to my chin ups which were lagging while I did my regular workouts too but I ended up being too fatigued and was eventually forced to choose between doing my regular workouts and greasing the groove so I decided to say "fuck it" and just do it exactly the way Pavel describes it.

I then took a week off of all exercise and decided when I went back to greasing the groove ==I wouldn't count sets and I would go by feel on how many reps to do.== If I had a pre-set number of reps like 5 then I just made that maximum number of reps per set and didn't allow myself to go beyond that but anything below that was fine, even 1 rep. And so I did chin ups literally whenever I felt like it, there was no timer anymore and I wasn't really counting sets. Sometimes I'd do 2 reps, sometimes one, sometimes 5 but I just went with what felt comfortable. I tried to be as lazy as possible (except of course I tried to maintain perfect form when I was doing the few reps that I did) and if there was even the slightest hesitation in me to do a set, I would just not do one.

My guess is that most days I only did 10 total reps.

What happened when I did it that way? I actually got stronger and stronger. My actual progression was doing a max of 3 reps per set then 4 then 5 then weighted chin ups (because Pavel says when greasing the groove with 5 reps is a walk in the park you should move on to adding external resistance) and that progression happened all within a month. Today I can do 30 strict bodyweight chin ups. When I was doing the 10 sets with the timer and being strict about doing every single rep I never progressed to doing 4 or 5 let alone using weights.

I was also doing a Dorian Yates style body building workout once a week and HIIT 2x a week both when I was doing "strict" Grease the Groove and now when doing a chill Grease the Groove. With the first one I felt like shit, I'd often feel like I was bordering on getting a fever but with the second one, I always feel fresh and never felt the need to take a break. In fact, a lot of times I felt just as fresh as when I took a week off.

Turns out Pavel was being serious when he said to just do a few reps here and there.

That was a little over one year ago. Grease the Groove done properly was actually what inspired me to do more Calisthenics work and I'm proud to say that today I can do a 1 arm pushup with shoulders square and feet shoulder width apart, strict ring & bar muscle ups, ring & bar front levers, and a human flag and I never felt like I was exercising or working out when I developed those movements, I only felt like I was '_practicing_'. In reality it probably wasn't easy for me to develop all those movements because it took quite a bit of time and I had to go through a lot of easier variations before I could do the actual move but it sure as hell felt easy because not once did I ever need motivation to practice the movements, I never had to contend with my willpower, in fact when I was feeling lazy I just allowed the urge to slack off to win. I never slacked off whenever I did practice those movements though because if I felt that there was a 1% chance that I'd do a lazy rep or if while I'm doing one rep I think the next rep would be a half-ass one, I just cut the set short and move on with my day.

With ring movements I don't think I've taken a single day off for more than a year now because I bring my rings with me anytime I travel and still, I always feel fresh as a daisy.

I'm truly amazed by this simple technique. I used to be very intimidated by the calisthenics movements that I can do now, thinking I'd have to go through hell and back to achieve them but today I'm just excited for the next new movement I can play with! And Grease the Groove truly feels like I'm just playing at this point.

One thing to be mindful of though is to watch out for overuse flareups/injuries. I greased the groove with chin ups and got a nasty case of elbow tendonitis.

> Strength through neurological adaptations but you can use that strength to lift more weight when doing hypertrophy work. Neurological adaptations for strength mean you're developing the ability to recruit more muscle fibers which means when you do your hypertrophy work you stimulate more of the muscle than you used to before doing something like GTG.

While greasing the groove the muscles are not overloaded like in a typical workout. Instead, you are increasing efficiency of the neural pathways for the exercise which is nerve related by performing the excercise frequently, but not to failure to prevent muscle fatiuge.

The trick is to start with low numbers of reps and bring it up slowly. I am the strongest I have ever been. There are obvious hypetrophy effects. I don’t warm up for any of my sets, but then again I warmed up and did joint preparation for years so I wouldn’t recommend it if there’s any hesitation about needing a warm up.

> I think it needs to be stressed that GTG is not the only way to increase reps and/or strength for any given skill - It's one of many ways. The whole idea behind the program is that you're practicing the skill and developing a neural connection that helps you move more efficiently and ultimately perform the skill better. That being said, ANY time you're performing a skill, you're practicing, albeit the biggest advantage of GTG is that you're practicing in a fresh state every time. This is why skill exercises usually take place before a workout or on a rest day. This is, of course, my opinion and I improved my pullup rep count without GTG. Although I do really like the idea of treating strength-based exercises the same way you would a skill exercise like a handstand.

I didn’t know it was a thing, but my reasoning was that you get good at what you do, and that I can’t over train if I don’t exert myself. It has helped tremendously with my push ups and I hope it will help my pull ups just as much!==

> I'm just going to say this, it is excellent for some movements that are of lower intensity. It allows you to build upon exercises that are relatively simple to achieve and do not cause too much stress to the joints. Doing this, for example, with one arm chin ups is a risk because trying it daily and working on say, negatives can increase the risk of developing elbow tendonitis or other issues (I did this specifically many years ago and resulted in horrible elbow pain). I think GTG is good for basic movements such as pull ups, push ups, dips, handstand holds, front lever work, and even some basic tuck planche holds. They are risky to do with higher level movements such as planches, maltese, iron cross, oac, etc. The basic idea is correct though, more volume means you get better at that movement.

GTG is a neurological stimulus and negatives are better for causing microtrauma and getting strength gains via your muscle getting bigger so I don't see a lot of value in negatives for GTG. They also cause more damage than just focusing on positives/concentric.

> > Grease the Groove is only great for developing strength and competence in movements, it doesn't affect how you look very much.
> > 
> > That said basically just do a few easy reps a day of an exercise/s that you're working on. If you don't have a movement that's lagging, it helps to have a big move you're developing like a muscle up. Just research easier progressions and work on those until you can do the actual movement, developing that one move should be enough to give you a lot of strength gains.
> > 
> > The way I get a sense of when its time to make things harder is I watch my speed. I try to go as fast as possible with each rep and if I slow down even a bit I end the set. If I set my max reps to 5 and I can do 5 reps throughout each day for 2-3 days very easily with the same speed then I'll move on to a harder progression or add weight.
> > 
> > I try to avoid negatives/eccentric too because those cause muscles damage and GTG is centered around being as fresh as possible so for example I did some grip work with a hand gripper and I only squeezed down but when it was time to release my grip I just let go all the way so that its almost like the gripper would fall off my hand. Basically I didn't resist it during the negative.
> > 
> > With the muscle up for example there is a progression called the baby muscle up where you basically do the whole move on lowered rings or a lower bar so that you can put your feet on the ground enough to help push you into the move. When I did that I only did the concentric then let go of the rings/bar and just positioned myself back on the bottom position for every rep.

Based on research you keep your gains for 3 months but I used to work as a personal trainer and I recorded every client's numbers in terms of weights and reps, once I had my best friend train under me, he quit working out for 9 months and in those 9 months we always hung out so I could see that he wasn't doing any exercise at all but when he finally decided to go back to training I had him lift his maxes from 9 months ago, he PR'ed every exercise!
