64\. Alpha sheets (later project, diff team) let you use R & Python code in a collaborative excel like spreadsheet.

Was like Light Table but from another direction.

Adds programming to Excel, versus adding better reactive env to programming

65\. Light table had a very Bret Victor type feel

make it easier to explore what you could do

make it easier to get a handle on what is going on in the program in real time

give yourself a bunch of contextual information and focus your attention only on what matters

66\. That project (Light Table) thus offered huge potential for "intelligence augmentation"

Allow people to solve problems that they otherwise wouldn't be capable of solving

Invent things they otherwise wouldn't have been capable of inventing

For beginners or experts alike!

67\. With both AlphaSheets and Light Table, you started with a tool and paradigm people were familiar with, and you added in either more programming power or a more powerful environment.

Both gave the users a clear path from where they were to a better world.

68\. Risk with both of those is incrementalism.

If you think that both excel and programming lead toward a dead end, perhaps you have to rethink things from first principles and go back to go forward.

Seemed like Chris's view

I don't \*exactly\* agree

69\. My take is you need co-evolution of tools and culture.

Tools shape us, then we shape our tools.

I believe in bootstrapping - in the Doug Engelbart sense.

Programming languages are as much about the community as about the underlying technology.
