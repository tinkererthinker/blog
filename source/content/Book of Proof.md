For another example, the equation $\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{n}{k}^2=\binom{2 n}{n}$ from Example 3.28 (page 109) is best phrased as a conditional statement, to make clear the assumption that $n$ is an integer.

Theorem If $n$ is a non-negative integer, then $\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{n}{k}^2=\binom{2 n}{n}$.
A theorem of the form "If $P$, then $Q$," can be regarded as a device that produces new information from $P$. Whenever we are dealing with a situation in which $P$ is true, then the theorem guarantees that, in addition, $Q$ is true. Since this kind of expansion of information is useful, theorems of the form "If P, then Q," are very common.
