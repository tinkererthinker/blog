Datasette is a tool for exploring and publishing data. It helps people take data of any shape, analyze and explore it, and publish it as an interactive website and accompanying API.

Datasette is aimed at data journalists, museum curators, archivists, local governments, scientists, researchers and anyone else who has data that they wish to share with the world. It is part of a wider ecosystem of [**44 tools**](https://datasette.io/tools) and [**154 plugins**](https://datasette.io/plugins) dedicated to making working with structured data as productive as possible.

**[Try a demo](https://datasette.io/global-power-plants/global-power-plants)** and explore 33,000 [[Power Plant|power plants]] around the world, then [follow the tutorial](https://datasette.io/tutorials/explore) or take a look at [some other examples](https://datasette.io/examples) of Datasette in action.

Then read how to [**get started with Datasette**](https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/getting_started.html), subscribe to [**the monthly-ish newsletter**](https://datasette.substack.com/) and consider [**signing up for office hours**](https://calendly.com/swillison/datasette-office-hours) for an in-person conversation about the project.
